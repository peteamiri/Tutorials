# SD-WAN

SD-WAN is not standards, there are various implementations. But Overall the SD-WAN categorise the infrustructure into three planes as listed below

* Data plane
* Controller plane
* Management Plane


## Difference between Software-defined Network and SD-WAN

Software-defined networking (SDN) is a concept that separates the network control plane from the data plane and centralizes the control in an SDN controller, which can be programmatically accessed and managed. SDN focuses on optimizing network functionality and performance by enabling the software-based automation and configuration of the network. It is typically used in the management of Local Area Networks (LAN) or carrier's core networks.

Software-defined Wide Area Network (SD-WAN) is a virtual WAN architecture that uses software to control the connectivity , management, and services between data centers, campus, and remote offices. It is designed to provide flexible, scalable, and cost-effective connectivity to branch offices and remote locations. An SD-WAN solution allows organizations to use multiple types of connectivity, such as broadband, LTE, and MPLS, and apply policies and routing rules to optimize the performance of their applications. In essence, SD-WAN is a specific use case for SDN.

So, while SDN and SD-WAN share some underlying concepts, the main difference between them is that SDN is more focused on managing LANs or carrier's core networks, while SD-WAN is designed to enable WANs and connectivity between remote locations.
