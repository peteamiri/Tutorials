# Networking

The first working network, called ARPANET, was created in the late 1960s and was funded by the U.S. Department of Defense. Government researchers used to share information at a time when computers were large and difficult to move. We have come a long way today from that basic kind of network. Today’s world revolves around the internet, which is a network of networks that connects billions of devices across the world. Organizations of all sizes use networks to connect their employees’ devices and shared resources such as printers.

## What is network

A computer network or simply network is a system of interconnected computing devices that are able to communicate with each other and share resources. This can include hardware components such as servers, workstations, routers, switches, and other network devices, as well as software components such as applications and data files. Computer networks are used to facilitate communication, data transfer, and resource sharing between devices, across both local and wide-area networks. They are the backbone of modern communication and enable many of the technologies and services we use today, including email, online gaming, social networking, cloud computing, and more.

## Network components
Computer network components are the physical and software elements that are needed to create and manage a computer network. These components include:

* Nodes or network devices - These are the computers, servers, switches, routers, hubs, and other networked devices that are connected together.

* Transmission media - This refers to the physical media or channels that are used to transmit data between devices. Examples include copper wires, fiber optic cables, and wireless radio frequencies.

* Network interface cards (NICs) - These are the hardware devices that are used to connect a computer or device to the network.

* Protocol - These are the set of rules and procedures that govern the communication between different devices on the network. Examples include TCP/IP, HTTP, FTP, and SMTP.

* Servers and clients - These are software applications that allow devices to access resources and services on the network. Servers provide these resources and services, while clients request access to them.

* Switches and routers - These are the network devices that manage the flow of data between different devices on the network. Switches are used to connect devices within a local area network (LAN), while routers are used to connect different networks or subnets together.

Overall, these components work together to create a functioning computer network that enables communication, resource sharing, and data transfer between different devices.

## Types of Network

There are various types of computer networks. Some common types of computer networks include:

Network by size:
1. Personal Area Network (PAN)
2. Local Area Network (LAN)
3. Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)
4. Wide Area Network (WAN)
5. Campus Area Network (CAN)
6. Global Area Network (GAN)

Network by Connection type
1. Wireless LAN (WLAN)
2. Moblle Network
3. Wired LAN

Network by function:
1. Storage Area Network (SAN)
2. System Area Network (SAN)
3. Virtual Private Network (VPN)

Logical Network
1. Intranet
2. Extranet

Each type of network has its own unique characteristics, topology, infrastructure, and use cases. The choice of network type depends on the requirements of the organization or user and the resources available.

## Network Models

Network models refer to conceptual models used to describe, analyze, and understand computer networks. These models are used to represent the behavior and interaction of different network components and can help identify and solve problems in network design, optimization, and efficiency. There are different types of network models, including the layered architecture of the OSI model, the TCP/IP model, and various other models used in the analysis and design of specific network protocols, algorithms, or technologies. Network models may include physical or abstract representations of network components, relationships, protocols, and functionalities, and are often used to simulate network behavior under different scenarios or conditions. Network models are essential in the development and management of computer networks, and can aid in achieving optimal performance and security.
