# Federal Enterprise Architecture Framework (FEAF)

The Federal Enterprise Architecture Framework (FEAF) was established in 1999 by the Chief Information Officers (CIO) 
in response to the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996.  

The purpose of the FEAF is to facilitate shared development of common processes and information among Federal Agencies and other 
government agencies.

Based on the FEAF, a given architecture can be partitioned into business, data, applications, and technology architectures:

* Business architecture: What is done, by whom, how, when and why.
* Data architecture: Information used by the Agency to do business.
* Application architecture: Computer applications/software that process the data according to defined business rules.
* Technology Architecture: Computer/communications technology / hardware that supports above three layers.
