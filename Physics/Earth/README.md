## History of Earth

The history of Earth spans over 4.5 billion years, from its formation through the present day. Here is a brief overview of the major eras and events in Earth's history:

* Hadean Eon (4.6 to 4 billion years ago): The earliest stage of Earth's history, during which the planet was formed through the accretion of material in the solar nebula.

* Archean Eon (4 to 2.5 billion years ago): During this era, the first life forms emerged on Earth, and the planet's atmosphere began to develop.

* Proterozoic Eon (2.5 billion to 541 million years ago): The Proterozoic eon saw the evolution of complex life forms, including the first multicellular organisms, as well as the formation of the supercontinent Rodinia.

* Phanerozoic Eon (541 million years ago to present day): The current eon, characterized by the explosion of life forms and the diversification of species. It is divided into three eras:

* Paleozoic Era (541 to 252 million years ago): During this era, life forms continued to evolve and diversify, with the emergence of fish, amphibians, reptiles, and the first insects. The Paleozoic era also saw the formation of the supercontinent Pangaea, which began to break apart towards the end of the era.

* Mesozoic Era (252 to 66 million years ago): The Mesozoic era is commonly known as the age of the dinosaurs, and saw the evolution and dominance of these reptiles. The era also saw the emergence of mammals, birds, and flowering plants.

* Cenozoic Era (66 million years ago to present day): The current era, characterized by the emergence and diversification of mammals, birds, and flowering plants, as well as the rise of humans.

Throughout Earth's history, there have been numerous major events, including mass extinctions, climate changes, and geological upheavals, that have shaped the planet and influenced the evolution of life.
