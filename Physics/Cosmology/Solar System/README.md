# Solar System

The stages of the Solar System can be broadly classified into four major phases, each marked by significant events and changes:

Formation: This phase began about 4.6 billion years ago, when a dense cloud of gas and dust began to collapse under the force of its own gravity. As the cloud collapsed, it began to spin faster and flatten into a disk. The center of the disk eventually became the Sun, while the surrounding material began to clump together to form planets and other objects.

Differentiation: As the clumps of material continued to grow and collide with one another, they began to differentiate into different types of objects. The largest objects, such as the planets, became rounded due to their own gravity and were able to retain an atmosphere and water. Smaller objects, such as asteroids and comets, remained irregularly shaped and were unable to retain an atmosphere.

Late Heavy Bombardment: About 3.9 billion years ago, the Solar System experienced a period of intense bombardment by comets, asteroids, and other objects. This event is known as the Late Heavy Bombardment and is thought to have shaped the inner Solar System and possibly even influenced the evolution of life on Earth.

Current Era: The current era of the Solar System is marked by relative stability and ongoing evolution. The planets continue to orbit the Sun, while smaller objects such as asteroids and comets occasionally collide with one another or with planets. The exploration of the Solar System by humans and robotic spacecraft has led to a deeper understanding of its history and evolution.

It's worth noting that these stages are broad and there are ongoing debates and research on the specifics of each phase. Additionally, the formation and evolution of the Solar System is closely tied to the broader processes of star and galaxy formation, and understanding these processes is key to understanding the history of our Solar System.

## Types of Star

Stars can be classified into several types based on various properties, including their temperature, size, and age. The following are some of the main types of stars:

Red Dwarfs: These are the most common type of star in the Milky Way, making up about 75% of all stars. They are relatively small and cool, with temperatures ranging from 2,200 to 3,500 Kelvin.

Yellow Dwarfs: These are stars similar to our Sun, with temperatures around 5,500 Kelvin. They are relatively small and have a lifespan of about 10 billion years.

Red Giants: These are large, cool stars that have exhausted their nuclear fuel and are in the later stages of their lives. They can be up to 1,000 times more luminous than the Sun.

Blue Giants: These are massive, hot stars with temperatures of up to 50,000 Kelvin. They are relatively rare and have short lifespans of only a few million years.

White Dwarfs: These are small, extremely dense stars that have exhausted their nuclear fuel and are no longer undergoing fusion reactions. They are typically about the size of Earth but have a mass similar to that of the Sun.

Neutron Stars: These are extremely dense stars that have collapsed to the point where protons and electrons have combined to form neutrons. They are the remnants of supernova explosions and can have masses of up to twice that of the Sun.

Black Holes: These are objects with such strong gravitational fields that nothing, not even light, can escape from them. They are formed when massive stars collapse under their own gravity.

It's worth noting that these categories are not necessarily mutually exclusive, and there is significant overlap between them. Additionally, there are ongoing debates and research on the specifics of star classification, and new types of stars are being discovered all the time.
