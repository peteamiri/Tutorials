# What are AWS Design Patterns?

AWS Design Patterns are solutions and design ideas for architecting applications on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud. These patterns provide guidance on how to use AWS services to address common challenges and requirements in software architecture. They are best practices developed through experience and are intended to help organizations build scalable, reliable, and cost-effective cloud-based systems.

Some key aspects and sources related to AWS Design Patterns include:

1. [Cloud Design Patterns Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/cloud-design-patterns/introduction.html): This guide offers insights into commonly used modernization design patterns using AWS services.

2. [AWS Cloud Design Patterns](https://en.clouddesignpattern.org/): The AWS Cloud Design Patterns (CDP) collection provides solutions and design ideas for using AWS cloud technology to solve common systems design challenges.
