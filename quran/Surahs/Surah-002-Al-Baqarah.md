"Alif, Lam, Meem."

This verse begins with three Arabic letters: Alif, Lam, and Meem. The meaning and significance of these individual letters are known only to Allah.

Verse 2:
"This is the Book about which there is no doubt, a guidance for those conscious of Allah."

This verse affirms that the Quran is a book of guidance without any doubt. It emphasizes that the Quran serves as a source of guidance for those who are conscious of Allah, those who are mindful of their relationship with Him and strive to live in accordance with His commands.

Verse 3:
"Who believe in the unseen, establish prayer, and spend out of what We have provided for them."

This verse describes the qualities and actions of the believers. They are those who have faith in the unseen, believe in the existence of Allah, the angels, the Hereafter, and other aspects of the unseen realm. Additionally, they establish regular prayer (Salah) and give generously from the provisions that Allah has blessed them with.

Verse 4:
"And who believe in what has been revealed to you, [O Muhammad], and what was revealed before you, and of the Hereafter they are certain [in faith]."

This verse emphasizes the importance of belief in the revelations that were sent to the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and the previous prophets. It also highlights the belief in the Hereafter as a fundamental aspect of faith.

Verse 5:
"Those are upon [right] guidance from their Lord, and it is those who are the successful."

This verse states that those who possess the qualities mentioned in the previous verses, such as belief in the unseen, establishing prayer, and having certainty in the Hereafter, are guided by their Lord. They are the ones who will attain success both in this world and in the Hereafter.

Verse 6:
"Indeed, those who disbelieve - it is all the same for them whether you warn them or do not warn them - they will not believe."

This verse highlights the response of those who disbelieve. It states that whether the Prophet Muhammad warns them or not, they will not believe. Their rejection of the message is a result of their hardened hearts and a conscious choice to turn away from the truth.

Verse 7:
"Allah has set a seal upon their hearts and upon their hearing, and over their vision is a veil. And for them is a great punishment."

This verse describes the consequence of the disbelief of certain individuals. Allah has sealed their hearts, making them resistant to guidance, and has placed a veil over their sight and hearing, preventing them from perceiving the truth. As a result, they will face a severe punishment in the Hereafter.

Verse 8:
"And of the people are some who say, 'We believe in Allah and the Last Day,' but they are not believers."

This verse addresses the hypocrisy of certain individuals who claim to believe in Allah and the Last Day but do not truly possess faith in their hearts. They may outwardly profess belief but lack sincerity and genuine commitment to Islam.

Verse 9:
"They [think to] deceive Allah and those who believe, but they deceive not except themselves and perceive [it] not."

This verse highlights the futile attempts of hypocrites to deceive Allah and the believers. However, their deception ultimately harms themselves, as they fail to realize that Allah is fully aware of their true intentions and actions.

Verse 10:
"In their hearts is disease, so Allah has increased their disease; and for them is a painful punishment because they [habitually] used to lie."

This verse highlights the spiritual and moral condition of certain individuals. Their hearts are afflicted with a disease, which refers to hypocrisy and disbelief. As a consequence of their falsehood and deception, Allah increases their spiritual ailment, and they will face a severe punishment in the Hereafter.

Verse 11:
"And when it is said to them, 'Do not cause corruption on the earth,' they say, 'We are but reformers.'"

This verse addresses the attitude of hypocrites who claim to be agents of positive change while engaging in corruption. When advised not to spread mischief and disorder in society, they defend themselves by asserting that they are only seeking to bring about reforms. However, their true intentions and actions contradict their claims.

Verse 12:
"Unquestionably, it is they who are the corrupters, but they perceive [it] not."

This verse exposes the reality of hypocrites who portray themselves as reformers. In truth, they are the ones who promote corruption and discord, even though they may be unaware of their own wrongdoing.

Verse 13:
"And when it is said to them, 'Believe as the people have believed,' they say, 'Should we believe as the foolish have believed?' Unquestionably, it is they who are the foolish, but they know [it] not."

This verse describes the response of hypocrites when urged to have faith and follow the path of the believers. They belittle the believers and consider their faith to be foolish. However, the true foolishness lies in their own disbelief and ignorance.

Verse 14:
"And when they meet those who believe, they say, 'We believe'; but when they are alone with their evil ones, they say, 'Indeed, we are with you; we were only mockers.'"

This verse highlights the hypocrisy of certain individuals. When in the company of believers, they claim to have faith, but when they are alone with their fellow hypocrites, they reveal their true allegiance and mock the beliefs of the believers.

Verse 15:
"[But] Allah mocks them and prolongs them in their transgression [while] they wander blindly."

This verse emphasizes that Allah, in His wisdom, allows hypocrites to persist in their wrongdoing. He exposes their true nature and leaves them to their own devices, allowing them to remain in a state of transgression and spiritual blindness.

Verse 16:
"Those are the ones who have purchased error [in exchange] for guidance, so their transaction has brought no profit, nor were they guided."

This verse describes the misguided choices of hypocrites. They willingly trade guidance for error and falsehood, and as a result, their transaction yields no profit or benefit. Their actions lead them astray, and they fail to attain true guidance.

Verse 17:
"Their example is that of one who kindled a fire, but when it illuminated what was around him, Allah took away their light, and left them in darkness [so] they could not see."

This verse presents an analogy to illustrate the situation of hypocrites. It compares them to someone who lights a fire to gain illumination but, as soon as the light appears, Allah extinguishes it, leaving them in darkness. This darkness symbolizes their lack of guidance and understanding.

Verse 18:
"They are deaf, dumb, and blind, so they will not return [to the right path]."

This verse continues the metaphorical description of the state of hypocrites. It highlights their spiritual deafness, inability to speak words of wisdom, and blindness to the truth. As a consequence, they remain misguided and are unlikely to repent and return to the right path.

Verse 19:
"Or [it is] like a rainstorm from the sky within which is darkness, thunder, and lightning. They put their fingers in their ears against the thunderclaps in dread of death. But Allah is encompassing of the disbelievers."

This verse presents another analogy to describe the condition of hypocrites. They are compared to people caught in a rainstorm with darkness, thunder, and lightning. In their fear of death, they cover their ears to block out the thunderclaps. However, Allah is fully aware of the disbelief and hypocrisy within their hearts.

Verse 20:
"The lightning almost snatches away their sight. Every time it lights [the way] for them, they walk therein; but when darkness comes over them, they stand [still]. And if Allah had willed, He could have taken away their hearing and their sight. Indeed, Allah is over all things competent."

This verse continues the analogy of the rainstorm. The lightning momentarily illuminates the path for hypocrites, and they walk in its light. However, when darkness falls upon them, they hesitate and stop moving forward. Allah could have easily taken away their ability to see and hear, but He grants them respite and allows them to make choices.

Verse 21:
"O mankind, worship your Lord, who created you and those before you, that you may become righteous."

This verse addresses all of humanity, inviting them to worship their Lord. It emphasizes that Allah is the Creator of all people and those who came before them. The purpose of worship is to attain righteousness and cultivate a righteous way of life.

Verse 22:
"[He] who made for you the earth a bed [spread out] and the sky a ceiling and sent down from the sky, rain and brought forth thereby fruits as provision for you. So, do not attribute to Allah equals while you know [that there is nothing similar to Him]."

This verse highlights the blessings and favors of Allah upon humanity. He has provided the Earth as a place of rest and sustenance, with the sky as a protective covering. Allah sends down rain from the sky, enabling the growth of fruits and providing sustenance for humankind. The verse also admonishes against associating partners with Allah, as He has no equals or partners.

Verse 23:
"And if you are in doubt about what We have sent down upon Our Servant [Muhammad], then produce a surah the like thereof and call upon your witnesses other than Allah, if you should be truthful."

This verse challenges the disbelievers to produce a surah (chapter) similar to the Quran if they doubt its divine origin. They are called upon to bring forth a literary or linguistic equivalent to the Quran. Additionally, they are asked to present witnesses who support their claim if they genuinely believe in their opposition.

Verse 24:
"But if you do not - and you will never be able to - then fear the Fire, whose fuel is men and stones, prepared for the disbelievers."

This verse continues the discussion about the inability of the disbelievers to produce a surah similar to the Quran. It emphasizes that they will never be able to achieve such a feat. As a consequence of their disbelief, they are warned about the Fire, which is prepared as a punishment for them. The Fire is described as being fueled by men and stones, symbolizing the severity of the punishment that awaits the disbelievers.

Verse 25:
"And give good tidings to those who believe and do righteous deeds that they will have gardens [in Paradise] beneath which rivers flow. Whenever they are provided with a provision of fruit therefrom, they will say, 'This is what we were provided with before.' And it is given to them in likeness. And they will have therein purified spouses, and they will abide therein eternally."

This verse provides glad tidings to the believers who have faith in Allah and perform righteous deeds. They will be rewarded with gardens in Paradise, adorned with flowing rivers. Whenever they are provided with the fruits of Paradise, they will find them similar to the blessings they enjoyed in the worldly life. In Paradise, they will also be granted purified spouses, and they will dwell there for eternity.

Verse 26:
"Indeed, Allah is not timid to present an example - that of a mosquito or what is smaller than it. And those who have believed know that it is the truth from their Lord. But as for those who disbelieve, they say, 'What did Allah intend by this as an example?' He misleads many thereby and guides many thereby. And He misleads not except the defiantly disobedient."

This verse emphasizes that Allah is not reluctant to present examples, even if they may seem insignificant, such as a mosquito or something smaller. The believers recognize that these examples are from the truth revealed by their Lord. However, the disbelievers question the purpose of such examples and are misled as a result. Allah guides those who are open to guidance and misleads those who persistently defy His commands.

Verse 27:
"Who break the covenant of Allah after contracting it and sever that which Allah has ordered to be joined and cause corruption on earth. It is those who are the losers."

This verse refers to those who break their covenant with Allah after making a commitment to follow His guidance. They violate the obligations that Allah has commanded to be upheld and contribute to corruption on the Earth. Such individuals are deemed to be losers, as they forsake their connection with Allah and engage in actions that disrupt societal harmony.

Verse 28:
"How can you disbelieve in Allah when you were lifeless and He brought you to life; then He will cause you to die, then He will bring you [back] to life, and then to Him you will be returned."

This verse highlights the logical inconsistency of disbelieving in Allah. It reminds people of their own origin when they were lifeless and were brought into existence by Allah. It further explains that Allah will cause them to die, then resurrect them, and finally, they will be returned to Him for accountability and judgment. The verse serves as a reminder of the power and authority of Allah over life and death.

Verse 29:
"It is He who created for you all of that which is on the Earth. Then He directed Himself to the heaven, [His being above all creation], and made them seven heavens, and He is Knowing of all things."

This verse highlights the power and knowledge of Allah. It affirms that He created everything on Earth for the benefit of humankind. Then, Allah turned His attention towards the heavens and created seven heavens, demonstrating His supremacy and knowledge of all things.

Verse 30:
"And [mention, O Muhammad], when your Lord said to the angels, 'Indeed, I will make upon the Earth a successive authority.' They said, 'Will You place upon it one who causes corruption therein and sheds blood, while we declare Your praise and sanctify You?' Allah said, 'Indeed, I know that which you do not know.'"

This verse narrates the conversation between Allah and the angels regarding the creation of a successive authority (human beings) on Earth. The angels express concern about the potential for corruption and bloodshed. However, Allah, in His infinite wisdom, assures them that He knows what they do not know, indicating His divine plan and purpose for creating mankind.

Verse 31:
"And He taught Adam the names - all of them. Then He showed them to the angels and said, 'Inform Me of the names of these, if you are truthful.'"

This verse mentions how Allah taught Adam the names of all things. Allah then presented these names to the angels and challenged them to inform Him of the names of those things if they were truthful in their claim of knowledge.

Verse 32:
"They said, 'Exalted are You; we have no knowledge except what You have taught us. Indeed, it is You who is the Knowing, the Wise.'"

The angels humbly acknowledge their limited knowledge and declare that they only possess the knowledge that Allah has taught them. They recognize Allah's exalted status and wisdom, affirming His superiority in knowledge and understanding.

Verse 33:
"He said, 'O Adam, inform them of their names.' And when he had informed them of their names, He said, 'Did I not tell you that I know the unseen [aspects] of the heavens and the Earth? And I know what you reveal and what you have concealed.'"

Allah instructs Adam to inform the angels of the names of those things. Adam, having been taught by Allah, successfully identifies the names. This further highlights Allah's knowledge of the seen and unseen aspects of the heavens and Earth. He knows what the angels reveal and what they keep hidden.

Verse 34:
"And [mention] when We said to the angels, 'Prostrate before Adam'; so they prostrated, except for Iblees. He refused and was arrogant and became of the disbelievers."

This verse recalls the command given to the angels to prostrate before Adam as a sign of respect and honor. All the angels obeyed this command except for Iblees (Satan), who refused to prostrate due to his arrogance and disbelief. Consequently, he became one of the disbelievers.

Verse 35:
"And We said, 'O Adam, dwell, you and your wife, in Paradise and eat therefrom in [ease and] abundance from wherever you will. But do not approach this tree, lest you be among the wrongdoers.'"

Allah commands Adam and his wife (Hawwa/Eve) to dwell in Paradise and enjoy its bounties freely, except for one tree from which they were forbidden to eat. They were warned that approaching that particular tree would make them among the wrongdoers.

Verse 36:
"But Satan caused them to slip out of it and removed them from that [condition] in which they had been. And We said, 'Go down, [all of you], as enemies to one another, and you will have upon the Earth a place of settlement and provision for a time.'"

This verse narrates the event of Adam and Eve being deceived by Satan (Iblees) and eating from the forbidden tree. As a result, they were expelled from Paradise and their original state of bliss. Allah decreed that they, along with their descendants, would become enemies to one another on Earth, and they would reside and sustain themselves there for a specified period of time.

Verse 37:
"Then Adam received from his Lord [some] words, and He accepted his repentance. Indeed, it is He who is the Accepting of repentance, the Merciful."

After Adam's mistake, he turned to his Lord in repentance. Allah accepted his repentance, showing His mercy and acceptance of those who sincerely seek forgiveness. This verse emphasizes that Allah is the ultimate acceptor of repentance and is full of mercy towards His creations.

Verse 38:
"We said, 'Go down from it, all of you. And when guidance comes to you from Me, whoever follows My guidance - there will be no fear concerning them, nor will they grieve.'"

In this verse, Allah addresses humanity as a whole, instructing them to descend from Paradise and inhabit the Earth. However, Allah assures them that those who receive and follow His guidance will have no fear or sorrow. This highlights the importance of adhering to the divine guidance for finding peace and contentment.

Verse 39:
"And those who disbelieve and deny Our signs - those will be companions of the Fire; they will abide therein eternally."

This verse describes the consequences for those who reject the signs and messages of Allah, choosing to disbelieve. Those who deny the signs of Allah and persist in disbelief will be inhabitants of the Fire (Hell) and will remain therein for eternity.

Verse 40:
"O Children of Israel, remember My favor which I have bestowed upon you and fulfill My covenant [upon you] that I will fulfill your covenant [from Me], and be afraid of [only] Me."

This verse specifically addresses the Children of Israel (the descendants of Prophet Jacob) and reminds them of the favors and blessings Allah bestowed upon them. They are urged to fulfill their covenant with Allah, just as He fulfills His promises to them. They are also advised to have a sense of fear and reverence exclusively towards Allah.

This verse emphasizes the importance of believing in the divine revelations sent by Allah, which confirm the truth already present in their scriptures. The Children of Israel are cautioned not to be the first to reject the new revelation brought by the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). They are warned against disregarding the signs of Allah for worldly gains and reminded to have fear and reverence only for Allah.

"And do not mix the truth with falsehood or conceal the truth while you know [it]."

It also encourages believers to join the congregation and bow in prayer alongside other worshippers, highlighting the significance of unity and community in worship.

Verse 44:
"Do you order righteousness of the people and forget yourselves while you recite the Scripture? Then will you not reason?"

This verse draws attention to the contradiction of urging others to practice righteousness while neglecting one's own actions. It reminds believers to reflect upon their own conduct and not neglect their own responsibilities and duties, especially when they are engaged in reciting the Scripture. It encourages self-reflection and the application of the teachings of the Scripture to one's own life.

Verse 45:
"And seek help through patience and prayer, and indeed, it is difficult except for the humbly submissive [to Allah]"

This verse advises believers to seek assistance and support through patience and prayer. It acknowledges that enduring patience and maintaining a consistent prayerful connection with Allah can be challenging, but it is an essential aspect of faith.

This verse is addressed to the Children of Israel, reminding them of the special favors and blessings Allah bestowed upon them, such as choosing them for prophethood and providing them with guidance. It emphasizes their distinction among the nations of the world, and serves as a reminder for them to be grateful for Allah's favor upon them.

Verse 48:
"And fear a Day when no soul will suffice for another soul at all, nor will intercession be accepted from it, nor will compensation be taken from it, nor will they be aided."

This verse warns of the Day of Judgment, emphasizing that on that day, no person will be able to intercede or compensate for another soul. Each individual will be held accountable for their own deeds and will not be able to rely on the help or intercession of others. It underscores the individual responsibility and accountability before Allah.

Verse 49:
"And [recall] when We saved your forefathers from the people of Pharaoh, who afflicted you with the worst torment, slaughtering your [newborn] sons and keeping your females alive. And in that was a great trial from your Lord."

This verse reminds the Children of Israel of the favor bestowed upon their ancestors when Allah rescued them from the oppressive rule of Pharaoh and the hardships they endured.

This verse continues to recount the miraculous event of the parting of the sea for the Children of Israel. Allah saved them from the oppression of the people of Pharaoh by causing the sea to split, allowing them to cross safely while drowning Pharaoh and his army. It serves as a reminder of Allah's power and His ability to protect His righteous servants.

Verse 51:
"And [recall] when We made an appointment with Moses for forty nights. Then you took [for worship] the calf after him, while you were wrongdoers."

This verse refers to the incident of the golden calf. After appointing Moses for a period of forty nights, during which he received divine revelation, the Children of Israel deviated from the path of monotheism and started worshiping a golden calf in his absence. This act of idolatry was a clear violation of their covenant with Allah, and they were in the wrong.

Verse 52:
"Then We forgave you after that so perhaps you would be grateful."

Despite their grave mistake, Allah forgave the Children of Israel after they realized their error and repented. This verse highlights the mercy and forgiveness of Allah, emphasizing the importance of gratitude for His benevolence.

Verse 53:
"And [recall] when We gave Moses the Scripture and criterion that perhaps you would be guided."

This verse reminds the Children of Israel of the favor bestowed upon them when Allah granted Moses the Scripture (Torah) and a criterion for distinguishing between right and wrong. The purpose of this gift was to guide them towards the path of righteousness and provide them with the necessary guidance for their lives.

Verse 54:
"And [recall] when Moses said to his people, 'O my people, indeed you have wronged yourselves by taking the calf [for worship]. So repent to your Creator and kill yourselves. That is best for [all of] you in the sight of your Creator.' Then He accepted your repentance; indeed, He is the Accepting of repentance, the Merciful."

This verse describes how Moses addressed his people, acknowledging their grave error in worshiping the golden calf. He urged them to repent sincerely to their Creator and commanded them to kill the culprits involved in the act of idolatry as a sign of their remorse and commitment to rectify their wrongdoing. Allah accepted their repentance and demonstrated His acceptance and mercy towards them.

Verse 55:
"And [recall] when you said, 'O Moses, we will never believe you until we see Allah outright'; so the thunderbolt took you while you were looking on."

This verse recounts an incident where the Children of Israel challenged Moses, demanding to witness Allah directly before they would believe. In response to their demand, they were struck by a thunderbolt, causing their death while they were observing the event. This incident serves as a lesson about the consequences of arrogance and disbelief.

Verse 56:
"Then We revived you after your death that perhaps you would be grateful."

After their death, Allah revived the Children of Israel, bringing them back to life as a sign of His power and mercy. This act was intended to instill gratitude in their hearts and remind them of Allah's favors upon them.

Verse 57:
"And We shaded you with clouds and sent down to you manna and quails, [saying], 'Eat from the good things with which We have provided you.' And they wronged Us not - but they were [only] wronging themselves."

This verse recalls the favors of Allah upon the Children of Israel during their journey in the wilderness. Allah provided them with shade through clouds and sent down sustenance in the form of manna (a sweet edible substance) and quails (birds) for them to eat. Despite these blessings, the Children of Israel did not wrong Allah, but rather they wronged themselves by disobeying His commands and turning away from His guidance.

Verse 58:
"And [recall] when We said, 'Enter this city and eat from it wherever you will in [ease and] abundance, and enter the gate bowing humbly and say, 'Relieve us of our burdens.' We will [then] forgive your sins for you, and We will increase the doers of good [in goodness and reward].'"

This verse refers to the command given to the Children of Israel to enter a city (most likely Jerusalem) and enjoy its provisions abundantly. They were instructed to enter the gate with humility, seeking forgiveness for their sins and asking Allah to relieve them of their burdens. Allah promised to forgive their sins and increase the rewards for those who do good.

Verse 59:
"But those who wronged changed [those words] to a statement other than that which had been said to them, so We sent upon those who wronged a punishment from the sky because they were defiantly disobeying."

This verse describes how the disobedient among the Children of Israel altered the words that were commanded to them. They distorted the commandments given to them and changed them into a different statement. As a result of their defiance and disobedience, Allah sent down a punishment upon them from the sky as a consequence of their wrongdoing.

Verse 60:
"And [recall] when Moses prayed for water for his people, so We said, 'Strike with your staff the stone.' And there gushed forth from it twelve springs, and every people knew its watering place. 'Eat and drink from the provision of Allah, and do not commit abuse on the Earth, spreading corruption.'"

This verse recounts an incident when the Children of Israel were in need of water during their journey. Moses supplicated to Allah, and in response, Allah commanded him to strike a stone with his staff. As a result, twelve springs gushed forth from the stone, providing each tribe of the Children of Israel with its own source of water. They were instructed to consume the sustenance provided by Allah and not to engage in wrongdoing or corruption on the Earth.

Verse 61:
"And [recall] when you said, 'O Moses, we can never endure one [kind of] food. So call upon your Lord to bring forth for us from the Earth its green herbs and its cucumbers and its garlic and its lentils and its onions.' He said, 'Would you exchange what is better for what is less? Go into [any] settlement and indeed, you will have what you have asked.' And they were covered with humiliation and poverty and returned with anger from Allah [upon them]. That was because they [repeatedly] disbelieved in the signs of Allah and killed the prophets without right. That was because they disobeyed and were [habitually] transgressing."

This verse narrates an incident where the Children of Israel complained to Moses about the lack of variety in their food, expressing their desire for different types of vegetables and spices. Moses reminded them of the provisions Allah had already granted them and questioned whether they were willing to exchange what was better for something lesser. Despite Moses' guidance, the Children of Israel persisted in their discontentment and were struck with humiliation and poverty as a consequence. Their disrespectful attitude towards Allah's blessings, repeated disbelief in His signs, and their history of killing prophets without justification were cited as reasons for their punishment.

Verse 63:
"And [recall] when We took your covenant, [O Children of Israel], and We raised over you the mount, [saying], 'Take what We have given you with determination and remember what is in it that perhaps you may become righteous.'"

This verse refers to the occasion when Allah took a covenant from the Children of Israel and raised Mount Sinai over them as a visible sign of their commitment. They were instructed to adhere firmly to the guidance given to them and to remember the teachings within it. The purpose was to inspire them to righteousness and adherence to their covenant with Allah.

Verse 64:
"But you turned away after that. So if not for the favor of Allah upon you and His mercy, you would have been among the losers."

This verse highlights the Children of Israel's failure to fulfill their covenant with Allah. Despite the blessings and signs bestowed upon them, they turned away from their obligations. Allah's favor and mercy upon them were the reasons they were not completely deprived of guidance and were given opportunities for redemption.

Verse 65:
"And you had already known about those who transgressed among you concerning the Sabbath, and We said to them, 'Be apes, despised.'"

This verse reminds the Children of Israel about a specific incident related to the violation of the Sabbath. Some among them had crossed the limits by engaging in prohibited activities on the Sabbath, and as a consequence of their disobedience, Allah transformed them into apes, making them a symbol of disgrace and humiliation.

Verse 66:
"And We made it a deterrent punishment for those who were present and those who succeeded [them] and a lesson for those who fear Allah."

This verse refers to the punishment inflicted upon the Children of Israel who violated the sanctity of the Sabbath. The transformation of some of them into apes served as a deterrent for both their contemporaries and future generations, as well as a lesson for those who fear Allah and strive to uphold His commands.

Verse 67:
"And [recall] when Moses said to his people, 'Indeed, Allah commands you to slaughter a cow.' They said, 'Do you take us in ridicule?' He said, 'I seek refuge in Allah from being among the ignorant.'"

This verse recounts an incident where Moses instructed the Children of Israel to sacrifice a cow as a religious command from Allah. Some of the people responded with reluctance, questioning Moses and suspecting him of mocking them. In response, Moses sought refuge in Allah from being associated with ignorance and clarified his sincere intention to follow Allah's command.

Verse 68:
"They said, 'Call upon your Lord to make clear to us what it is.' [Moses] said, '[Allah] says, 'It is a cow which is neither old nor virgin, but median between that,' so do what you are commanded.'"

The Children of Israel requested further details regarding the cow they were instructed to sacrifice. They asked Moses to seek clarification from Allah regarding its specific characteristics. In response, Moses conveyed Allah's command that the cow should be neither old nor young, but of a middle age. He urged them to comply with the instructions they had been given.

Verse 69:
"They said, 'Call upon your Lord to show us what is her color.' He said, 'He says, 'It is a yellow cow, bright in color - pleasing to the observers.'"

The Children of Israel further sought clarification on the cow's color. Moses consulted Allah and relayed the response that it should be a yellow cow, bright and pleasing to the eyes of those who observe it.

Verse 70:
"They said, 'Call upon your Lord to make clear to us what it is. Indeed, [all] cows look alike to us. And indeed we, if Allah wills, will be guided.'"

The people of Israel, still uncertain, requested Moses to ask Allah for further clarification, as they found it difficult to distinguish between different cows. They expressed their willingness to follow the guidance once it was made clear to them, if it was the will of Allah.

Verse 71:
"[Moses] said, 'He says, 'It is a cow neither trained to plow the earth nor to irrigate the field, one free from fault with no spot upon her.'' They said, 'Now you have come with the truth.' So they slaughtered her, but they could hardly do it."

Moses conveyed Allah's response that the cow should be neither trained for agricultural work nor used for irrigation. It should be without any faults or blemishes. The people recognized the accuracy of the description and proceeded to slaughter the specified cow, albeit with difficulty.

Verse 72:
"And [recall] when you slew a man and disputed over it, but Allah was to bring out that which you were concealing."

This verse recalls an incident where the Children of Israel were involved in the killing of a person, and there was a dispute among them regarding the matter. Allah, with His knowledge, was aware of the hidden aspects of the incident and ultimately exposed the truth.

Verse 73:
"So We said, 'Strike the slain man with part of it.' Thus does Allah bring the dead to life, and He shows you His signs that you might reason."

This verse refers to the command given to the Children of Israel to strike the slain man with a portion of the sacrificed cow. Through this act, Allah demonstrated His power to bring the dead back to life and displayed His signs as a means for people to reflect and use their intellect.

Verse 74:
"Then your hearts became hardened after that, being like stones or even harder. For indeed, there are stones from which rivers burst forth, and there are some of them that split open and water comes out, and there are some of them that fall down for fear of Allah. And Allah is not unaware of what you do."

In this verse, Allah admonishes the Children of Israel for their hardened hearts and their refusal to accept guidance. Despite witnessing miraculous signs and revelations, their hearts had become so callous that they were compared to stones, or even harder. Allah reminds them that even stones have the ability to split open, release water, or tremble out of awe and fear of Allah. This serves as a reminder that Allah is fully aware of their actions and deeds.

Verse 75:
"Do you covet [the hope, O believers], that they would believe for you while a party of them used to hear the words of Allah and then distort the Torah after they had understood it while they were knowing?"

This verse addresses the Muslims, reminding them not to wish or hope that the disbelieving Jews would believe in their message. It points out that there were among them those who intentionally distorted the words of Allah in the Torah, even though they understood its true meanings and teachings. This serves as a cautionary reminder about the deceitful practices of some individuals.

Verse 76:
"And when they meet those who believe, they say, 'We have believed'; but when they are alone with their evil ones, they say, 'Indeed, we are with you; we were only mockers.'"

This verse highlights the hypocrisy of the disbelieving Jews. When they encountered the believers, they would claim to believe as well. However, when they were alone with their like-minded companions, they would express their true allegiance, stating that they were only mocking the believers. This serves as a warning against false pretenses and deceitful behavior.

Verse 77:
"Allah mocks them and prolongs them in their transgression [while] they wander blindly."

This verse states that Allah, in response to their mockery and transgression, mocks and ridicules them. He allows them to persist in their wrongdoing, leading them further astray and causing them to remain in a state of blindness and ignorance.

Verse 78:
"Those are the ones who have purchased error [in exchange] for guidance, so their transaction has brought no profit, nor were they guided."

This verse describes those who have willingly chosen to exchange true guidance for misguidance, thereby making a futile transaction. Their choice has yielded no benefit or profit, and they have failed to find the true path of guidance.

Verse 79:
"Their example is that of one who kindled a fire, but when it illuminated what was around him, Allah took away their light and left them in darkness [so] they could not see."

This verse presents an analogy to illustrate the condition of those who deliberately reject guidance. It compares them to someone who kindles a fire and experiences a temporary illumination. However, Allah takes away their light, leaving them in utter darkness where they can no longer perceive or understand the truth.

Verse 80:
"And they say, 'The Fire is only for the disbelievers; we will not be sent to it except for a few [days].'"

In this verse, it is mentioned that some people claim that the punishment of the Fire is only for the disbelievers and that they will only be sent to it for a short duration. This statement reflects their arrogance and denial of the consequences of their actions.

Verse 81:
"Say, 'Have you taken a covenant with Allah? For Allah will never break His covenant. Or do you say about Allah that which you do not know?'"

The response from Allah to their claim is conveyed through this verse. It emphasizes that Allah does not break His promises and that they have no authority to make such assertions about Allah without proper knowledge. This challenges their baseless assumptions and reminds them to not speak about Allah without knowledge.

Verse 82:
"Yes, whoever earns evil and his sin has encompassed him - those are the companions of the Fire; they will abide therein eternally."

This verse clarifies the consequences of committing evil deeds and the sinful actions of individuals. It states that those who engage in evil and have been encompassed by the consequences of their sins will be companions of the Fire, where they will remain for eternity. It highlights the seriousness and permanence of the punishment for those who persist in wrongdoing.

Verse 83:
"But they who believe and do righteous deeds - those are the companions of Paradise; they will abide therein eternally."

Conversely, this verse mentions the reward for those who believe in Allah and perform righteous deeds. They are referred to as the companions of Paradise, where they will dwell forever. It emphasizes the eternal and everlasting nature of the reward for those who have faith and engage in good deeds.

Verse 84:
"And [recall] when We took your covenant, [saying], 'Do not shed each other's blood or evict one another from your homes.' Then you acknowledged [this] while you were witnessing."

This verse refers to the covenant taken from the Children of Israel, where they were commanded not to shed one another's blood or unjustly expel one another from their homes. They acknowledged this covenant while being witnesses to it, indicating their agreement and acceptance of the commandment.

Verse 85:
"Then you are those [same ones who are] killing one another and evicting a party of your people from their homes, cooperating against them in sin and aggression. And if they come to you as captives, you ransom them, although their eviction was forbidden to you. So do you believe in part of the Scripture and disbelieve in part? Then what is the recompense for those who do that among you except disgrace in worldly life; and on the Day of Resurrection they will be sent back to the severest of punishment. And Allah is not unaware of what you do."

This verse highlights the contradiction in the behavior of the Children of Israel. Despite their initial agreement to refrain from shedding blood and expelling their own people from their homes, they were engaged in killing one another and committing acts of aggression. Additionally, they would ransom their captives, although expelling them had been forbidden. The verse questions their selective belief in parts of the Scripture while disregarding other parts. It warns them of the disgrace they will face in worldly life as a consequence of their actions and the severe punishment they will face on the Day of Resurrection. Allah is fully aware of their deeds and holds them accountable for their inconsistencies.

Verse 86:
"Those are the ones who have bought the life of this world [in exchange] for the Hereafter, so the punishment will not be lightened for them, nor will they be aided."

This verse describes those who prioritize worldly desires and pleasures over the eternal life of the Hereafter. They are willing to trade the rewards and blessings of the Hereafter for the temporary enjoyment of this worldly life. As a consequence of their choices, the punishment awaiting them in the Hereafter will not be lightened, and they will not receive any support or assistance.

Verse 87:
"And We certainly gave Moses the Scripture and followed up after him with messengers. And We gave Jesus, the son of Mary, clear proofs and supported him with the Pure Spirit. But is it [not] that every time a messenger came to you, [O Children of Israel], with what your souls did not desire, you were arrogant? And a party [of messengers] you denied and another party you killed."

In this verse, Allah reminds the Children of Israel of how He bestowed upon Moses the Scripture and sent subsequent messengers to guide them, including Jesus, the son of Mary. These messengers were given clear signs and miracles, and they were supported by the Pure Spirit (referring to the angel Gabriel). However, despite the messengers' teachings not aligning with their personal desires, the Children of Israel exhibited arrogance. They rejected and even killed some of the messengers sent to them.

Verse 88:
"And they said, 'Our hearts are wrapped.' But, [in fact], Allah has cursed them for their disbelief, so little is it that they believe."

The verse mentions the response of the disbelievers among the Children of Israel, who claimed that their hearts were veiled or covered, preventing them from comprehending the message. In reality, it was their disbelief and rejection of the truth that led to their curse from Allah. They had very little belief, if any at all.

Verse 89:
"And when there came to them a Book from Allah confirming that which was with them - although before they used to pray for victory against those who disbelieved - but [then] when there came to them that which they recognized, they disbelieved in it; so the curse of Allah will be upon the disbelievers."

This verse refers to the situation when a new revelation, the Quran, came to the disbelieving Jews, confirming what was already present in their previous scriptures. Despite their prior prayers for victory against the disbelievers, when they were presented with the truth they recognized, they rejected it. As a consequence, they incurred the curse of Allah due to their disbelief.

Verse 90:
"How wretched is that for which they sold themselves - that they would disbelieve in what Allah has revealed through [their] outrage that Allah would send down His favor upon whom He wills from among His servants. So they returned having [earned] wrath upon wrath. And for the disbelievers is a humiliating punishment."

This verse highlights the miserable trade made by the disbelievers among the Children of Israel. They willingly sold their faith and chose to disbelieve in the revelations that Allah sent, out of their jealousy and resentment that Allah bestows His favor upon whom He wills among His servants. As a consequence of their actions, they returned with layers of wrath upon them. The verse concludes by indicating that the disbelievers will face a humiliating punishment.

Verse 91:
"When it is said to them, 'Believe in what Allah has revealed,' they say, 'We believe [only] in what was revealed to us.' And they disbelieve in what came after it, while it is the truth confirming that which is with them. Say, 'Then why did you kill the prophets of Allah before, if you are [indeed] believers?'"

This verse addresses the disbelievers among the Children of Israel who reject the belief in the Quran as a continuation and confirmation of the previous scriptures. They claim to believe only in what was revealed to them, rejecting what came after it. The verse challenges their inconsistent beliefs and reminds them of their past transgressions, including the killing of the prophets of Allah. It questions their claim of being true believers if they had resorted to such actions.

Verse 92:
"And Moses had certainly brought you clear proofs. Then you took the calf [in worship] after that, while you were wrongdoers."

This verse reminds the Children of Israel of the clear signs and miracles brought by Moses as evidence of his prophethood. Despite witnessing these signs, they deviated from the right path and worshiped the golden calf. Their actions were unjust and a violation of the commandments of Allah.

Verse 93:
"And [recall] when We took your covenant and raised over you the mount, [saying], 'Take what We have given you with determination and listen.' They said [instead], 'We hear and disobey.' And their hearts absorbed [the worship of] the calf because of their disbelief. Say, 'How wretched is that which your faith enjoins upon you, if you should be believers.'"

This verse refers to the incident when Allah made a covenant with the Children of Israel at Mount Sinai. They were commanded to follow and adhere to the teachings and commandments given to them. However, they responded with disobedience, stating that they would listen but would not follow. As a consequence of their disbelief, their hearts became inclined towards worshiping the calf. The verse highlights the contradiction in their faith and admonishes them for the wretchedness of their actions if they claim to be true believers.

Verse 94:
"Say, 'If the home of the Hereafter with Allah is for you alone and not the [other] people, then wish for death, if you should be truthful.'"

This verse challenges the disbelievers among the Children of Israel who considered themselves exclusive recipients of Allah's blessings in the Hereafter. The verse suggests that if they truly believe in their superiority and exclusion of others, they should eagerly desire death to attain the rewards they claim to be reserved for themselves alone.

Verse 95:
"But they will never wish for it, ever, because of what their hands have put forth. And Allah is Knowing of the wrongdoers."

This verse explains that the disbelievers among the Children of Israel will never sincerely desire death and the Hereafter because they are aware of the consequences of their own wrongful actions. They understand that their deeds have led them astray, and they fear the accountability for their choices. Allah is fully aware of the wrongdoings committed by such individuals.

Verse 96:
"And you will surely find them the most greedy of people for life - [even] more than those who associate others with Allah. One of them wishes that he could be granted life a thousand years, but it would not remove him in the least from the [coming] punishment that he should be granted life. And Allah is Seeing of what they do."

This verse describes the excessive attachment of the disbelievers, particularly among the Children of Israel, to worldly life. They are portrayed as being more eager for the pleasures and comforts of this life than even those who associate partners with Allah. One of their desires is to live for a thousand years, hoping that a prolonged life would protect them from the impending punishment. However, the verse clarifies that such extended life would not grant them any reprieve from the punishment destined for them. Allah is fully aware of their actions and intentions.

Verse 97:
Say, "Whoever is an enemy to Gabriel - it is [none but] he who has brought the Qur'an down upon your heart, [O Muhammad], by permission of Allah, confirming that which was before it and as guidance and good tidings for the believers."

In this verse, the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) is commanded to convey the message that whoever shows enmity towards the angel Gabriel is, in fact, displaying enmity towards Allah. Gabriel is the one who brought down the Quran upon the heart of the Prophet by the permission of Allah. The Quran serves as a confirmation and continuation of the previous scriptures, as well as a source of guidance and glad tidings for the believers.

Verse 98:
"Whoever is an enemy to Allah and His angels and His messengers and Gabriel and Michael - then indeed, Allah is an enemy to the disbelievers."

This verse further emphasizes that anyone who opposes Allah, His angels, His messengers, including Gabriel and Michael, earns the enmity of Allah. The disbelievers who harbor hostility towards the divine messengers and their message make themselves the enemies of Allah.

Verse 99:
"And We have certainly revealed to you verses [which are] clear proofs, and no one would deny them except the defiantly disobedient."

This verse highlights that Allah has revealed clear and evident signs and verses to the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). These signs are undeniable and serve as proofs of the truth. However, only the defiantly disobedient individuals reject and deny them, displaying their stubbornness and refusal to submit to the truth.

Verse 100:
"Is it not [true] that every time they took a covenant a party of them threw it away? But, [in fact], most of them do not believe."

This verse points out the behavior of the disbelievers among the Children of Israel, highlighting their habit of breaking their covenants with Allah. Despite making promises and agreements, they would frequently disregard and violate them. The verse concludes by stating that the majority of them do not truly have faith.

Verse 101:
"And when a messenger from Allah came to them confirming that which was with them, a party of those who had been given the Scripture threw the Scripture of Allah behind their backs as if they did not know [what it contained]."

This verse refers to the attitude of some of the People of the Book (Jews and Christians) when the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) came to them with the Quran, which confirmed the truth within their own scriptures. Instead of recognizing the truth and accepting the Quran, a faction among them disregarded the message and metaphorically discarded the teachings of Allah as if they were ignorant of its contents. This demonstrates their rejection and unwillingness to follow the guidance.

Verse 102:
"And they followed [instead] what the devils had recited during the reign of Solomon. It was not Solomon who disbelieved, but the devils disbelieved, teaching people magic and that which was revealed to the two angels at Babylon, Harut and Marut. But the two angels do not teach anyone unless they say, 'We are a trial, so do not disbelieve [by practicing magic].' And [yet] they learn from them that by which they cause separation between a man and his wife. But they do not harm anyone through it except by permission of Allah. And the people learn what harms them and does not benefit them. But the Children of Israel certainly knew that whoever purchased the magic would not have in the Hereafter any share. And wretched is that for which they sold themselves, if they only knew."

This verse recounts the story of how some among the Children of Israel turned to the practice of magic, taught by the devils during the time of Prophet Solomon (peace be upon him). It clarifies that it was not Prophet Solomon himself who disbelieved, but rather the devils who disbelieved by promoting magic and leading people astray. The two angels mentioned, Harut and Marut, were sent as a trial to test the people. They explicitly warned that magic is a form of disbelief and should not be practiced. However, some individuals chose to learn magic from them, using it to cause discord between spouses. The verse emphasizes that magic has no real power unless permitted by Allah, and those who engage in it are only harming themselves. The Children of Israel were well aware that those who pursued magic would have no share in the Hereafter, yet they persisted in their actions, making a terrible trade by sacrificing their faith for worldly gains.

Verse 103:
"And if they had believed and feared Allah, then the reward from Allah would have been [far] better, if they only knew."

This verse highlights the missed opportunity of the Children of Israel. Had they believed in Allah and adhered to His guidance, their reward from Allah would have been far superior to any worldly gains they pursued through magic or disbelief. The verse indicates that their lack of understanding prevented them from realizing the immense blessings and rewards they would have received had they chosen the path of faith and piety.

Verse 104:
"O you who have believed, do not say [to Allah's Messenger], 'Ra'ina' but say, 'Unzurna' and listen. And for the disbelievers is a painful punishment."

This verse addresses the believers and advises them not to use a derogatory term "Ra'ina" (which means "Look at us" in Arabic) when addressing the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). Instead, they are instructed to use the word "Unzurna" (which means "Look upon us with favor" or "Grant us attention") as a respectful and polite way of seeking his attention. This serves as a reminder to show proper respect and reverence to the Prophet and to communicate with him in a manner that reflects honor and dignity. The verse also warns the disbelievers that they will face a painful punishment.

Verse 105:
"Neither those who disbelieve from the People of the Scripture nor the polytheists wish that any good should be sent down to you from your Lord. But Allah selects for His mercy whom He wills, and Allah is the possessor of great bounty."

This verse indicates that the disbelievers among the People of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) and the polytheists are not sincerely interested in the well-being and guidance that comes from Allah. They are not desirous of any good being revealed to the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). However, Allah, in His wisdom, chooses to bestow His mercy upon whomever He wills, irrespective of their background. Allah's mercy is abundant and encompasses all His creation.

Verse 106:
"We do not abrogate a verse or cause it to be forgotten except that We bring forth [one] better than it or similar to it. Do you not know that Allah is over all things competent?"

This verse clarifies the concept of abrogation in the Quran, which means that certain verses are replaced or modified by later revelations. Allah, out of His wisdom and knowledge, may substitute a verse with one that is better in terms of guidance and clarity or one that carries a similar meaning. The verse emphasizes that Allah has full authority and competence over all things, including the revelations He sends down. This highlights the divine wisdom behind any changes or modifications in the Quranic verses.

Verse 107:
"Do you not know that to Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and [that] you have not besides Allah any protector or any helper?"

This verse serves as a reminder of the absolute sovereignty of Allah over the heavens and the earth. It emphasizes that there is no deity or authority besides Allah. It also emphasizes the fact that no one has the power to protect or assist people except Allah alone. The verse encourages believers to place their trust and reliance solely on Allah, recognizing His unmatched authority and support.

Verse 108:
"Or do you intend to ask your Messenger as Moses was asked before? And whoever exchanges faith for disbelief has certainly strayed from the soundness of the way."

This verse addresses the believers and challenges them about their intention to question the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) in a manner similar to how the people of Moses (peace be upon him) questioned him in the past. The verse implies that such questioning is unnecessary and inappropriate. It also warns that anyone who abandons their faith and exchanges it for disbelief has indeed deviated from the path of righteousness and guidance.

Verse 109:
"Many of the People of the Scripture wish they could turn you back to disbelief after you have believed, out of envy from themselves [even] after the truth has become clear to them. So pardon and overlook until Allah delivers His command. Indeed, Allah is over all things competent."

This verse addresses the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and informs him that many among the People of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) harbor a strong desire to lead him away from his faith and make him revert to disbelief. They feel envious and resentful due to the clarity of the truth that has been revealed to him. Despite their attempts, the Prophet is instructed to pardon their hostility and overlook their malicious intentions until Allah's command comes to fruition. Allah, being all-powerful, is capable of dealing with their actions and bringing about the ultimate resolution.

Verse 110:
"And establish prayer and give zakah, and whatever good you put forward for yourselves - you will find it with Allah. Indeed, Allah of what you do, is Seeing."

In this verse, the believers are encouraged to establish prayer and fulfill their obligation of giving zakah (charitable contributions). They are reminded that any acts of goodness and righteousness they perform will be rewarded by Allah. Whatever they do for the sake of Allah, they will find its reward with Him. Allah is fully aware and observant of their actions, and He will acknowledge and reward them accordingly.

Verse 111:
"And they say, 'None will enter Paradise except one who is a Jew or a Christian.' That is [merely] their wishful thinking, Say, 'Produce your proof if you should be truthful.'"

This verse addresses the false claim made by some Jews and Christians that only people from their respective religions will enter Paradise. Allah instructs the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) to challenge them to provide evidence for their assertion if they are truthful in their claim. This highlights the baseless nature of their statement and calls for logical reasoning and evidence-based arguments.

Verse 112:
"Yes, [on the contrary], whoever submits his face in Islam to Allah while being a doer of good will have his reward with his Lord. And no fear will there be concerning them, nor will they grieve."

This verse establishes the principle that true acceptance and submission to Allah, regardless of one's religious background, is what leads to reward and salvation. Those who willingly submit themselves to Allah, embrace Islam, and perform righteous deeds will be rewarded by their Lord. Such individuals will be free from fear and grief, as Allah will bestow His mercy and protection upon them.

Verse 113:
"The Jews say, 'The Christians have nothing [true] to stand on,' and the Christians say, 'The Jews have nothing to stand on,' although they [both] recite the Scripture. Thus the polytheists speak the same as their words. But Allah will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning that over which they used to differ."

This verse highlights the divisions and disputes among the Jews, Christians, and polytheists. Each group claims that the other has no basis or foundation for their beliefs, despite all of them reciting scriptures. Allah reminds them that He will be the ultimate judge on the Day of Resurrection, settling the differences and disputes that arise from their conflicting claims.

Verse 114:
"And who is more unjust than one who prevents the name of Allah from being mentioned in His mosques and strives toward their destruction? It is not for them to enter them except in fear. For them in this world is disgrace, and they will have in the Hereafter a great punishment."

This verse addresses the grave injustice committed by those who prevent the remembrance of Allah and the mention of His name in His mosques. They engage in efforts to destroy and harm these sacred places of worship. The verse emphasizes that such individuals will not be allowed to enter the mosques, except in a state of fear and apprehension. Their actions will result in disgrace in this worldly life, and they will face severe punishment in the Hereafter.

Verse 115:
"And to Allah belongs the east and the west. So wherever you [might] turn, there is the Face of Allah. Indeed, Allah is all-Encompassing and Knowing."

This verse highlights the all-encompassing sovereignty of Allah. It affirms that Allah's dominion extends over all directions, encompassing the east and the west. Therefore, wherever believers may turn or face during their acts of worship, they are always facing the direction of Allah's countenance. Allah's knowledge and awareness are vast and comprehensive, encompassing all things.

Verse 116:
"They say, 'Allah has taken a son.' Exalted is He! Rather, to Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth. All are devoutly obedient to Him."

This verse refutes the false belief of attributing a son to Allah. It asserts the oneness and transcendence of Allah, emphasizing that everything in the heavens and the earth belongs to Him. All of creation, including the celestial beings and the inhabitants of the earth, are obedient to Allah and fulfill His commandments.

Verse 117:
"The Originator of the heavens and the earth. When He decrees a matter, He only says to it, 'Be,' and it is."

This verse emphasizes the power and authority of Allah as the Creator of the heavens and the earth. Allah is the one who initiates and brings into existence all things. When Allah decrees something to happen, He simply commands it to be, and it instantly comes into existence. This serves as a reminder of Allah's unlimited power and ability to bring about any matter with a single command.

Verse 118:
"And those who have no knowledge say, 'Why does Allah not speak to us or there come to us a sign?' Thus spoke those before them like their words. Their hearts resemble each other. We have shown clearly the signs to a people who are certain [in faith]."

This verse highlights the misguided questioning of those who lack knowledge and understanding. They demand direct communication from Allah or miraculous signs to prove His existence and message. The verse asserts that such demands are similar to the claims made by those who came before them. Their hearts share the same inclination towards disbelief. However, Allah has already presented clear signs and evidence of His existence and message to those who possess certainty in faith.

Verse 119:
"Indeed, We have sent you, [O Muhammad], with the truth as a bringer of good tidings and a warner, and you will not be asked about the companions of Hellfire."

This verse reiterates the role of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) as a messenger of Allah. He is entrusted with conveying the truth, delivering glad tidings to the believers, and warning the people about the consequences of their actions. The verse emphasizes that the Prophet will not be held accountable for the choices made by individuals who end up in Hellfire. His responsibility is to convey the message faithfully.

Verse 120:
"And never will the Jews or the Christians approve of you until you follow their religion. Say, 'Indeed, the guidance of Allah is the [only] guidance.' If you were to follow their desires after what has come to you of knowledge, you would have against Allah no protector or helper."

This verse addresses the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and highlights the fact that the Jews and Christians will not be satisfied or pleased with him unless he follows their respective religions. The Prophet is instructed to respond by affirming that the true guidance comes from Allah alone. If he were to abandon the revelation he has received and follow their desires instead, he would have no guardian or supporter against the consequences of deviating from the true path.

Verse 121:
"Those to whom We have given the Book recite it with its true recital. They [are the ones who] believe in it. And whoever disbelieves in it - it is they who are the losers."

This verse highlights the importance of correctly reciting and understanding the scripture that Allah has revealed. The believers who have been granted the Book (referring to the earlier revealed scriptures such as the Torah and the Gospel) recite it with sincerity and adhere to its true teachings. On the other hand, those who disbelieve in it and reject its guidance are the ones who will ultimately suffer loss.

Verse 122:
"O Children of Israel, remember My favor which I have bestowed upon you and fulfill My covenant [upon you] that I will fulfill your covenant [from Me], and be afraid of [only] Me."

In this verse, Allah addresses the Children of Israel (the descendants of Prophet Jacob, also known as Israel) and reminds them of the favors bestowed upon them. Allah reminds them of the covenant between Himself and the Israelites, urging them to fulfill their part of the covenant just as Allah fulfills His promises. The verse emphasizes the importance of maintaining a reverent fear of Allah and being conscious of their duties towards Him.

Verse 123:
"And believe in what I have sent down confirming that which is [already] with you, and be not the first to disbelieve in it. And do not exchange My signs for a small price, and fear [only] Me."

This verse instructs the Children of Israel to believe in the revelation sent down by Allah, which confirms and affirms the previous scriptures that were already in their possession. They are advised not to be among the first to reject or disbelieve in the new revelation brought by Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). The verse also warns against trivializing or disregarding the signs and miracles of Allah for worldly gains. The emphasis is placed on having fear and reverence for Allah alone.

Verse 124:
"And [recall] when Moses said to his people, 'O my people, remember the favor of Allah upon you when He appointed among you prophets and made you possessors and gave you that which He had not given anyone among the worlds.'"

This verse refers to Prophet Moses (peace be upon him) addressing the Children of Israel, reminding them of the blessings and favors bestowed upon them by Allah. Moses reminds them of their special status as a chosen nation, with the appointment of prophets from among them and the granting of possessions and blessings that had not been bestowed upon any other community in the world.

Verse 125:
"O my people, enter the Holy Land which Allah has assigned to you and do not turn back [from fighting in Allah 's cause] and [thus] become losers."

Here, Moses urges his people to enter the Holy Land, which Allah has designated for them. He encourages them to face the challenges and obstacles they may encounter, without retreating or giving up in the face of adversity. By persisting and maintaining their commitment to Allah's cause, they will attain victory and avoid the loss and regret of turning back.

Verse 126:
"They said, 'O Moses, indeed within it is a people of tyrannical strength, and indeed, we will never enter it until they leave it; but if they leave it, then we will enter.'"

The response of the Children of Israel to Moses' call is mentioned in this verse. They express their fear and hesitation in entering the Holy Land due to the presence of a formidable and oppressive people. They suggest that they will only enter the land if those people leave it. Their response indicates a lack of trust in Allah's promise and a reliance on their own calculations.

Verse 127:
"Said two men from those who feared [to disobey] upon whom Allah had bestowed favor, 'Enter upon them through the gate, for when you have entered it, you will be predominant. And upon Allah rely, if you should be believers.'"

Here, two individuals among the Children of Israel, who were known for their piety and fear of disobeying Allah, express their faith and confidence. They advise the people to enter the land through the gate with trust in Allah's promise. They assure their fellow believers that upon entering, they will surely overcome their enemies. Their advice emphasizes the importance of relying on Allah and demonstrating true faith.

Verse 128:
"They said, 'O Moses, indeed we will not enter it, ever, as long as they are within it; so go, you and your Lord, and fight. Indeed, we are remaining right here.'"

Despite the advice of the two righteous individuals, the majority of the Children of Israel persist in their refusal to enter the Holy Land. They assert that they will never enter as long as the powerful people inhabit it. They tell Moses to go and fight with his Lord, implying that they will remain where they are without taking part in the struggle.

Verse 129:
"[Moses] said, 'My Lord, indeed I do not possess except myself and my brother, so part us from the defiantly disobedient people.'"

Moses prays to Allah, acknowledging his limited resources and manpower. He seeks separation from the defiantly disobedient among his people, asking Allah to allow him and his brother Aaron to be distinguished from those who refuse to obey and follow the divine guidance.

Verse 130:
"[Allah] said, 'Then indeed, it is forbidden to them for forty years [in which] they will wander throughout the land. So do not grieve over the defiantly disobedient people.'"

In response to Moses' prayer, Allah decrees that the Children of Israel will be prohibited from entering the Holy Land for a period of forty years. During this time, they will wander aimlessly throughout the land. Allah reassures Moses not to grieve over the disobedient among his people, as their punishment is ordained by Allah's wisdom and divine decree.

Verse 131:
"And inform them about the story of Adam's two sons, in truth, when they both offered a sacrifice [to Allah], and it was accepted from one of them but was not accepted from the other. Said [the latter], 'I will surely kill you.' Said [the former], 'Indeed, Allah only accepts from the righteous [who fear Him].'"

In this verse, Allah instructs the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) to narrate the story of Adam's two sons, Cain (Qabil) and Abel (Habil). Both of them presented a sacrifice to Allah, but only Abel's sacrifice was accepted, while Cain's was rejected. Out of jealousy, Cain threatens to kill his brother. Abel responds by reminding Cain that Allah accepts offerings only from the righteous, those who fear and obey Him.

Verse 132:
"And if you [both] raise your hand against me to kill me, I shall not raise my hand against you to kill you. Indeed, I fear Allah, Lord of the worlds."

Abel further demonstrates his righteousness and piety by refusing to retaliate or harm his brother, even when facing the threat of death. He asserts that he will not raise his hand against Cain because he fears Allah, the Lord of all creation. This verse highlights the importance of forbearance, forgiveness, and fear of Allah in the face of hostility and conflict.

Verse 133:
"Indeed, I want you to obtain [thereby] my sin and your sin so you will be among the companions of the Fire. And that is the recompense of wrongdoers."

Abel warns Cain of the consequences of his intended action. He tells him that by killing him, Cain will bear the burden of his own sin as well as Abel's sin, and as a result, he will become one of the inhabitants of the Fire (Hell). This verse emphasizes the gravity of committing a wrong act and the accountability that comes with it.

Verse 134:
"But his soul prompted to him the murder of his brother, so he killed him and became among the losers."

Despite Abel's admonition, Cain's evil inclination overwhelms him, and he proceeds to kill his brother. This act of murder leads him to become one of the losers, suffering both in this world and in the Hereafter due to his heinous crime.

Verse 135:
"Then Allah sent a crow searching in the ground to show him how to hide the disgrace of his brother. He said, 'O woe to me! Have I failed to be like this crow and hide the body of my brother?' And he became of the regretful."

After committing the murder, Cain is overwhelmed with remorse and regret. Allah sends a crow to scratch the ground and show Cain how to conceal the dead body of his brother. Witnessing this, Cain is filled with sorrow, realizing that even a bird knows how to conceal its wrongdoing, while he failed to do so. He becomes deeply remorseful for his actions.

Verse 136:
"Say, [O believers], 'We have believed in Allah and what has been revealed to us and what has been revealed to Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and the Descendants and what was given to Moses and Jesus and what was given to the prophets from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them, and we are Muslims [in submission] to Him.'"

In this verse, the believers are instructed to affirm their faith and declare that they believe in Allah and all the revelations sent to the various prophets. They recognize the common source of guidance from Allah, whether it was revealed to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, Jesus, or any other prophet. The believers are unified in their submission to Allah, without making distinctions or differences between the messengers of Allah.

Verse 137:
"So if they believe in the same as you believe in, then they have been [rightly] guided; but if they turn away, they are only in dissension, and Allah will be sufficient for you against them. And He is the Hearing, the Knowing."

This verse indicates that if the People of the Book (Jews and Christians) believe in the same message that the Muslims believe in, they would be rightly guided. However, if they choose to turn away from the truth, it will lead to division and conflict. Allah assures the believers that He is sufficient to defend them against any opposition or disbelief. Allah is All-Hearing of their words and All-Knowing of their intentions.

Verse 138:
"[Say], 'Our faith is in Allah and that which has been revealed to us and that which has been revealed to Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and the Descendants and that which was given to Moses and Jesus and the prophets from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them, and we are Muslims [in submission] to Him.'"

This verse reiterates the declaration of faith made by the believers. They affirm their belief in Allah and the revelations sent to all the prophets, including Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, the descendants, Moses, Jesus, and the other prophets. Once again, they emphasize their rejection of any distinction or preference among the messengers, and they declare their submission to Allah.

Verse 139:
"Say, 'Do you argue with us about Allah while He is our Lord and your Lord? For us are our deeds, and for you are your deeds. And we are sincere [in deed and intention] to Him.'"

This verse addresses the dispute between the believers and the People of the Book concerning Allah. The believers are told to respond to their arguments by affirming that Allah is the Lord of both the believers and the disbelievers. Each group will be accountable for their own deeds, and the believers are sincere in their worship and devotion to Allah.

Verse 140:
"Or do you say that Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and the Descendants were Jews or Christians? Say, 'Are you more knowing or is Allah?' And who is more unjust than one who conceals a testimony he has from Allah? And Allah is not unaware of what you do."

In this verse, the disbelievers are challenged regarding their claim that Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and their descendants were Jews or Christians. The believers are instructed to respond by asking the disbelievers if they possess greater knowledge than Allah Himself. The verse emphasizes the injustice of those who conceal or distort the truth they have received from Allah, and it asserts that Allah is fully aware of their actions.

Verse 141:
"That is a nation which has passed on. It will have [the consequence of] what it earned, and you will have what you have earned. And you will not be asked about what they used to do."

This verse reminds the believers that the previous nations, including the people of Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, and Jacob, have already passed away. Each nation will be held accountable for its own actions and deeds. The believers are reminded that they will be judged based on their own deeds and will not be questioned about the actions of those who came before them.

Verse 142:
"The foolish among the people will say, 'What has turned them away from their qiblah, which they used to face?' Say, 'To Allah belongs the east and the west. He guides whom He wills to a straight path.'"

Here, the Quran addresses the criticism of some foolish individuals who question the change in the qiblah (the direction of prayer) from Jerusalem to the Kaaba in Makkah. The believers are advised to respond by affirming that Allah, the Lord of the east and the west, guides whomever He wills to the straight path. The change in the qiblah serves as a test of faith and obedience, and Allah's guidance is not confined to any specific direction.

Verse 143:
"And thus We have made you a just community that you will be witnesses over the people and the Messenger will be a witness over you. And We did not make the qiblah which you used to face except that We might make evident who would follow the Messenger from who would turn back on his heels. And indeed, it is difficult except for those whom Allah has guided. And never would Allah have caused you to lose your faith. Indeed Allah is, to the people, Kind and Merciful."

This verse highlights the role of the Muslim community as a just and upright nation. They are appointed as witnesses over humanity, reflecting the teachings of the Messenger (Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him). The change in the qiblah was a test to distinguish those who truly followed the Messenger from those who turned away from his guidance. Allah reassures the believers that those who are guided by Him will find the change easy, and Allah will not let their faith go to waste. Allah is Kind and Merciful towards all people.

Verse 144:
"We have certainly seen the turning of your face, [O Muhammad], toward the heaven, and We will surely turn you to a qiblah with which you will be pleased. So turn your face toward al-Masjid al-Haram. And wherever you [believers] are, turn your faces toward it [in prayer]. Indeed, those who have been given the Scripture well know that it is the truth from their Lord. And Allah is not unaware of what they do."

This verse addresses the change in the qiblah (the direction of prayer) for the Muslims. Initially, the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) used to pray towards Jerusalem, but later Allah revealed that the new qiblah would be the Kaaba in Makkah. The believers are instructed to turn their faces towards the Kaaba during prayer, regardless of their location. It is emphasized that the People of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) recognize the truth of this change, and Allah is fully aware of their actions.

Verse 145:
"And even if you brought to those who were given the Scripture every sign, they would not follow your qiblah. Nor will you be a follower of their qiblah. Nor would they be followers of one another's qiblah. So if you were to follow their desires after what has come to you of knowledge, indeed, you would then be among the wrongdoers."

In this verse, the believers are informed that the People of the Scripture would not follow the qiblah of the Muslims, even if the believers were to present them with every sign and evidence. The believers are also advised not to follow the desires and preferences of the People of the Scripture in matters of faith. If the believers were to abandon their own knowledge and submit to the desires of others, they would be among the wrongdoers.

Verse 146:
"Those to whom We gave the Scripture know him as they know their own sons. But indeed, a party of them conceal the truth while they know [it]."

This verse acknowledges that there are some among the People of the Scripture who recognize and acknowledge the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) as they recognize their own children. However, despite their knowledge of the truth, a faction among them deliberately conceals it and refuses to accept the Prophet Muhammad's prophethood.

Verse 147:
"The truth is from your Lord, so never be among the doubters."

This verse emphasizes that the truth revealed by Allah is absolute and comes from the Lord Himself. The believers are reminded not to fall into doubt or uncertainty regarding the truth of Islam and the message brought by the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).

Verse 148:
"For each [religious following] is a direction toward which it faces. So race to [all that is] good. Wherever you may be, Allah will bring you forth [for judgement] all together. Indeed, Allah is over all things competent."

This verse acknowledges that different religious communities have their own directions of prayer. However, the believers are encouraged to compete in performing righteous deeds and acts of goodness. Allah assures that regardless of their location, all individuals will be gathered together on the Day of Judgment, and Allah has full power and competence over all things.

Verse 149:
"From wherever you go out [for prayer], turn your face toward al-Masjid al-Haram. And wherever you [believers] may be, turn your faces toward it in order that the people will not have any argument against you, except for those of them who commit wrong; so fear them not but fear Me. And [it is] so I may complete My favor upon you and that you may be guided."

This verse reiterates the importance of facing the Kaaba (al-Masjid al-Haram) in Makkah during prayer. It instructs the believers that no matter where they are, they should turn their faces towards the Kaaba to avoid giving any room for arguments or disputes from others, except for those who intentionally commit wrong. The believers are reminded to fear Allah alone and not be influenced by the fear of others. By adhering to this guidance, Allah's favor will be completed upon them, and they will be rightly guided.

Verse 150:
"Just as We have sent among you a messenger from yourselves reciting to you Our verses and purifying you and teaching you the Book and wisdom and teaching you that which you did not know."

This verse refers to the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) who was sent as a messenger from among the people, reciting Allah's verses and purifying them. The Prophet was entrusted with the task of teaching the Book (the Quran) and wisdom, as well as enlightening the believers about matters they were previously unaware of. Through his teachings, the Prophet Muhammad brought knowledge and guidance to the community.

Verse 151:
"So remember Me; I will remember you. And be grateful to Me and do not deny Me."

In this verse, Allah encourages the believers to remember Him in all their affairs and worship. Allah promises to remember them in return. The believers are also advised to be grateful to Allah for His blessings and not to deny or reject His favors upon them.

Verse 152:
"O you who have believed, seek help through patience and prayer. Indeed, Allah is with the patient."

This verse addresses the believers directly, advising them to seek assistance and support from Allah through patience and prayer. Patience and steadfastness in the face of challenges, combined with sincere supplication to Allah, are the means to find solace and strength. The verse assures the believers that Allah is with those who exercise patience.

Verse 153:
"And do not say about those who are killed in the way of Allah, 'They are dead.' Rather, they are alive, but you perceive [it] not."

This verse emphasizes the concept of martyrdom and the status of those who are killed in the path of Allah. The believers are cautioned against considering them as dead, for they are indeed alive in the presence of Allah, although their physical presence may no longer be visible to us. It highlights the spiritual and eternal existence of the martyrs in the sight of Allah.

Verse 154:
"And We will surely test you with something of fear and hunger and a loss of wealth and lives and fruits, but give good tidings to the patient."

Here, Allah informs the believers that they will inevitably face trials and tests in their lives, including experiences of fear, hunger, loss of wealth, loss of lives, and other difficulties. However, the believers are given glad tidings and encouragement to remain patient in the face of adversity. Patience is recognized as a virtue and a means to overcome challenges and attain reward from Allah.

Verse 155:
"And We will surely test you with something of fear and hunger and a loss of wealth and lives and fruits, but give good tidings to the patient."

This verse reminds the believers that they will inevitably face tests and trials in their lives. These tests can take the form of fear, hunger, loss of wealth, loss of lives, or even scarcity of provisions. However, the believers are encouraged to remain patient and steadfast in the face of these challenges. The verse assures them that good tidings await those who demonstrate patience during times of difficulty.

Verse 156:
"Who, when disaster strikes them, say, 'Indeed we belong to Allah, and indeed to Him we will return.'"

In this verse, the response of the believers to calamities and hardships is highlighted. When faced with a disaster or tragedy, the believers recognize that they ultimately belong to Allah and will eventually return to Him. This response reflects their deep faith and reliance on Allah's decree, knowing that He is the ultimate source of comfort and solace during times of adversity.

Verse 157:
"Those are the ones upon whom are blessings from their Lord and mercy. And it is those who are the [rightly] guided."

This verse emphasizes that the believers who demonstrate patience and trust in Allah during difficult times are the recipients of blessings and mercy from their Lord. They are the ones who are rightly guided, as they rely on Allah's guidance and follow His commands even in challenging circumstances.

Verse 158:
"Indeed, as-Safa and al-Marwah are among the symbols of Allah. So whoever makes Hajj to the House or performs 'umrah - there is no blame upon him for walking between them. And whoever volunteers good - then indeed, Allah is appreciative and Knowing."

Here, the symbols of Allah, as-Safa and al-Marwah, are mentioned. These are two hills or landmarks near the Kaaba in Makkah. During the pilgrimage (Hajj) or the lesser pilgrimage ('Umrah), it is a practice to walk between these two points as a part of the religious rituals. The verse clarifies that there is no blame upon the pilgrims who perform this act. Additionally, it emphasizes that whoever volunteers to perform acts of goodness beyond the prescribed rituals, Allah is appreciative of their efforts and has knowledge of their intentions.

Verse 159:
"Indeed, those who conceal what We sent down of clear proofs and guidance after We made it clear for the people in the Scripture - those are cursed by Allah and cursed by those who curse."

This verse addresses those who deliberately hide or conceal the clear revelations and guidance that Allah has sent down, even after it has been made clear to the people in the Scripture. Such individuals who distort or conceal the truth are subjected to the curse of Allah and the curse of others who invoke curses upon them.

Verse 160:
"Except for those who repent and correct themselves and make evident [what they concealed]. Those - I will accept their repentance, and I am the Accepting of repentance, the Merciful."

However, this verse offers hope for those who have concealed the truth. It states that if they sincerely repent, correct their actions, and reveal what they had previously concealed, Allah will accept their repentance. Allah is described as the Accepting of repentance and the Merciful, highlighting His readiness to forgive those who turn back to Him in repentance.

Verse 161:
"Indeed, those who disbelieve and die while they are disbelievers - upon them will be the curse of Allah and of the angels and the people, all together."

This verse highlights the consequences of dying in a state of disbelief. Those who reject faith and die without accepting the truth will be subjected to the curse of Allah, the curse of the angels, and the curse of all people. It emphasizes the severity of persisting in disbelief and the dire outcome it brings.

Verse 162:
"They will abide therein eternally. The punishment will not be lightened for them, nor will they be reprieved."

This verse explains that those who persist in disbelief will face eternal punishment in the Hereafter. They will remain in that state without any alleviation or respite from their torment. The punishment will neither be lessened nor will they be granted any reprieve or respite from it.

This verse draws attention to the signs of Allah's existence and power evident in the creation of the heavens and the earth. The alternation of night and day is mentioned as one of the signs that should serve as a reminder and reflection for those who possess understanding and intellect.

Verse 165:
"Who remember Allah while standing or sitting or [lying] on their sides and give thought to the creation of the heavens and the earth, [saying], 'Our Lord, You did not create this aimlessly; exalted are You [above such a thing]; then protect us from the punishment of the Fire.'"

This verse describes the characteristics of the believers who remember Allah in various postures and positions, whether standing, sitting, or lying down. They ponder upon the creation of the heavens and the earth, recognizing that it was not created without purpose or meaning. They acknowledge the greatness of Allah and beseech Him to protect them from the punishment of the Fire (Hell).

Verse 166:
"Our Lord, indeed whoever You admit to the Fire - You have disgraced him, and for the wrongdoers there are no helpers."

Here, the believers address Allah, acknowledging that whoever is admitted to the Fire (Hell) by His decree will be disgraced and humiliated. They recognize that for the wrongdoers, there will be no one to assist or help them in their dire situation.

Say, 'Who revealed the Scripture that Moses brought as light and guidance to the people?' You [Jews] make it into pages, disclosing [some of] it and concealing much. And you were taught that which you knew not - neither you nor your fathers.' Say, 'Allah [revealed it].' Then leave them in their [empty] discourse, amusing themselves."

This verse addresses the disbelievers who fail to recognize the true status and value of Allah's revelations. They claim that Allah did not reveal anything to any human being. In response, the believers are instructed to question the disbelievers about the revelation given to Prophet Moses, which served as a source of light and guidance for the people. The disbelievers are reminded that they alter the contents of the Scripture, selectively disclosing certain parts while concealing others. They are also reminded that the knowledge they possess was not acquired by themselves or their forefathers but was bestowed upon them by Allah. The believers are advised to leave the disbelievers engaged in their empty arguments and trivial pursuits.

Verse 170:
"This worldly life is only amusement and diversion. And if you believe and fear Allah, He will give you your rewards and not ask you for your properties."

This verse reminds the believers that the worldly life, with its distractions and amusements, is temporary and fleeting. It is not the ultimate purpose of existence.

They said, 'Yes, we have testified.' [This] - lest you should say on the Day of Resurrection, 'Indeed, we were of this unaware.'"

This verse mentions a significant event in which Allah took a covenant from the descendants of Adam, extracting their souls from his loins and making them bear witness to His lordship. Allah asked them, "Am I not your Lord?" and they responded in affirmation, bearing witness that Allah is their Lord. This covenant was taken to prevent anyone from claiming ignorance or unawareness on the Day of Resurrection about their acknowledgment of Allah's lordship.

Verse 173:
"[ Allah ] said, 'Because of your saying, 'We have testified.' But while you were unaware, Allah was calling you to witness that He is your Lord, and you were heedless."

In this verse, Allah responds to their testimony by affirming that He indeed took their witness. However, at the time of that covenant, they were unaware of the profound meaning and implications of their testimony. Allah was calling them to bear witness to Him, but they were heedless and oblivious to the significance of His call.

Verse 174:
"That was [i.e., the covenant] so you might not deny the favor of Allah upon you and [that] you might not disbelieve."

The purpose of this covenant was to prevent them from denying or rejecting the favors and blessings bestowed upon them by Allah. It served as a means to strengthen their faith and prevent them from falling into disbelief.

Verse 175:
"And [mention] when We said, 'Enter this city and eat from it wherever you will in [ease and] abundance, and enter the gate bowing humbly and say, 'Relieve us of our burdens.' We will [then] forgive your sins for you, and We will increase the doers of good [in goodness and reward].'"

This verse recalls another event when Allah instructed the Children of Israel to enter a specific city and enjoy its provisions abundantly. They were required to enter the city with humility, seeking forgiveness from Allah and requesting relief from their burdens. Allah promised to forgive their sins and reward those who do good with even more goodness.

Verse 178:
"O you who have believed, prescribed for you is legal retribution for those murdered - the free for the free, the slave for the slave, and the female for the female. But whoever overlooks from his brother anything, then there should be a suitable follow-up and payment to him with good conduct. This is an alleviation from your Lord and a mercy. But whoever transgresses after that will have a painful punishment."

In this verse, believers are informed about the prescribed legal retribution for cases of murder. The principle of equal retaliation is established: if a free person is killed, the punishment is the killing of the murderer; if a slave is killed, the punishment is the killing of the slave murderer; and if a female is killed, the punishment is the killing of the female murderer. However, there is also room for forgiveness and reconciliation, where the family of the victim may choose to forgive the perpetrator and accept monetary compensation or other forms of compensation. This allowance for forgiveness is a mercy and a means of reconciliation from Allah. It is emphasized that those who transgress the boundaries and refuse to follow the prescribed retribution will face a painful punishment.

Verse 179:
"And there is for you in legal retribution [saving of] life, O you [people] of understanding, that you may become righteous."

This verse highlights the wisdom behind the prescribed legal retribution. It serves as a means to save lives and create a sense of justice in society. By establishing these laws, people of understanding are encouraged to strive for righteousness and uphold the principles of justice and equity.

This verse addresses the issue of making bequests and providing for one's parents and close relatives upon one's impending death. It is prescribed as a duty for the righteous to leave behind provisions and bequests for their parents and near relatives, in accordance with what is fair and acceptable.

"Then whoever alters the bequest after he has heard it - the sin is only upon those who have altered it. Indeed, Allah is Hearing and Knowing."

This verse warns against tampering with a bequest or altering its terms after hearing it. Those who engage in such actions bear the sin and responsibility for their wrongdoing. Allah, being All-Hearing and All-Knowing, is fully aware of their actions.

Verse 182:
"But whoever fears from a testator [some] error or sin and corrects that which is between them - there is no sin upon him. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful."

This verse provides guidance for those who fear that a testator may have committed an error or sin in their bequest. If someone recognizes a mistake or wrongdoing in the bequest and rectifies it in a just manner, there is no sin upon them. Allah is Forgiving and Merciful, understanding the intentions and efforts of individuals to rectify any errors in the bequest.

Verse 183:
"O you who have believed, decreed upon you is fasting as it was decreed upon those before you that you may become righteous."

This verse introduces the obligation of fasting, which was prescribed for the believers. Fasting is described as a practice that was also enjoined upon the previous nations, serving as a means to attain righteousness and develop self-discipline.

Verse 184:
"[Fasting for] a limited number of days. So whoever among you is ill or on a journey [during them] - then an equal number of days [are to be made up]. And upon those who are able [to fast, but with hardship] - a ransom [as substitute] of feeding a poor person [each day]. And whoever volunteers excess - it is better for him. But to fast is best for you, if you only knew."

This verse discusses the rules and options regarding fasting. It specifies that fasting is prescribed for a limited number of days during the month of Ramadan. However, if someone is ill or traveling during those days, they are exempt from fasting and are required to make up the missed days at a later time. For those who are physically capable of fasting but find it excessively difficult, they have the option to offer a ransom by feeding a poor person for each day missed. Additionally, it is mentioned that voluntary fasting beyond the obligatory days is commendable and brings additional reward. The verse concludes by stating that fasting is the best option overall, if only people knew the immense benefits it brings.

Verse 185:
"The month of Ramadan [is that] in which the Qur'an was revealed as guidance for the people and clear proofs of guidance and criterion. So whoever sights [the new moon of] the month, let him fast it; and whoever is ill or on a journey - then an equal number of other days. Allah intends for you ease and does not intend for you hardship and [wants] for you to complete the period and to glorify Allah for that [to] which He has guided you; and perhaps you will be grateful."

This verse highlights the significance of the month of Ramadan as the period during which the Qur'an was revealed as a source of guidance and a criterion for distinguishing between right and wrong. It instructs believers to fast during this month upon sighting the new moon, with exceptions for those who are ill or traveling, as mentioned previously.

The verse encourages believers to complete the prescribed period of fasting and to express gratitude to Allah for the guidance bestowed upon them.

Verse 186:
"When My servants ask you concerning Me, indeed I am near. I respond to the invocation of the supplicant when he calls upon Me. So let them respond to Me [by obedience] and believe in Me that they may be [rightly] guided."

This verse conveys Allah's nearness and His willingness to respond to the supplications of His servants when they call upon Him. Believers are encouraged to turn to Allah, respond to His call, and have faith in Him, as it is through this connection and belief that they will find true guidance.

Verse 187:
"It has been made permissible for you the night preceding fasting to go to your wives [for sexual relations]. They are clothing for you and you are clothing for them. Allah knows that you used to deceive yourselves, so He accepted your repentance and forgave you. So now, have relations with them and seek that which Allah has decreed for you. And eat and drink until the white thread of dawn becomes distinct to you from the black thread [of night]. Then complete the fast until the night. And do not have relations with them as long as you are staying for worship in the mosques. These are the limits [set by] Allah, so do not approach them. Thus does Allah make clear His ordinances to the people that they may become righteous."

This verse provides guidance on the rules of fasting and intimate relations during the month of Ramadan. It states that it is permissible for individuals to have intimate relations with their spouses during the nights of fasting, but they must abstain from such relations during the day while fasting. It emphasizes that spouses are like garments for one another, providing comfort, protection, and companionship. Allah is aware that people used to engage in deception by intentionally delaying the pre-dawn meal, so He forgave them and allowed them to have relations during the nights. It also reminds believers to begin their fast at the break of dawn when the distinction between the white thread of light and the black thread of darkness becomes clear. The verse concludes by highlighting the importance of adhering to the limits set by Allah and obeying His ordinances in order to attain righteousness.

Verse 188:

Verse 189:
"They ask you, [O Muhammad], about the new moons. Say, 'They are measurements of time for the people and for Hajj.' And it is not righteousness to enter houses from the back, but righteousness is [in] one who fears Allah. And enter houses from their doors. And fear Allah that you may succeed."

In this verse, the question is raised regarding the significance of the new moons. The response emphasizes that the sighting of the new moons serves as a means to determine the time for various religious obligations, including the performance of Hajj. The verse also reminds believers that righteousness is not determined by entering houses through the back entrances or engaging in external rituals, but rather by fearing Allah, upholding His commandments, and entering houses through their proper doors. It emphasizes the importance of having a conscious awareness of Allah's presence and following His guidance in order to achieve success.

Transgression is disapproved by Allah, and the verse emphasizes the importance of maintaining justice and moderation even in times of conflict.

Verse 191:
"And kill them wherever you overtake them and expel them from wherever they have expelled you, and fitnah is worse than killing. And do not fight them at al-Masjid al- Haram until they fight you there. But if they fight you, then kill them. Such is the recompense of the disbelievers."

This verse addresses the context of defensive warfare against those who have initiated aggression.

Verse 193:
"And fight them until there is no fitnah and [until] the religion, all of it, is for Allah. And if they cease - then indeed, Allah is Seeing of what they do."

This verse establishes the objective of defensive warfare, which is to eliminate aggression and the causes of conflict (fitnah) until there is peace and the establishment of Allah's religion.

Verse 196:
"And complete the Hajj and 'Umrah for Allah. But if you are prevented, then [offer] what can be obtained with ease of sacrificial animals. And do not shave your heads until the sacrificial animal has reached its place of slaughter. And whoever among you is ill or has an ailment of the head [making shaving necessary must offer] a ransom of fasting [three days] or charity or sacrifice. And when you are secure, then whoever performs 'Umrah [during the Hajj months] followed by Hajj [offers] what can be obtained with ease of sacrificial animals. And whoever cannot find [or afford such an animal] - then a fast of three days during Hajj and of seven when you have returned [home]. Those are ten complete [days]. This is for those whose family is not in the area of al-Masjid al-Haram. And fear Allah and know that Allah is severe in penalty."

This verse discusses the rituals of Hajj (pilgrimage) and 'Umrah (lesser pilgrimage) and provides guidance on how to perform them. It advises believers to complete the prescribed rituals of Hajj and 'Umrah for the sake of Allah. If circumstances prevent them from completing the rituals, they are instructed to offer a sacrificial animal instead. The verse further instructs that the shaving of the head should be delayed until the sacrificial animal has been slaughtered. If someone is unable to shave their head due to illness or any head-related ailment, they can offer a ransom by either fasting for three days, giving charity, or sacrificing an animal. Once the pilgrims are in a state of security, those who perform 'Umrah during the Hajj months followed by Hajj are allowed to offer a sacrificial animal as part of their Hajj rituals. If a person cannot find or afford an animal for sacrifice, they are required to fast for three days during Hajj and for an additional seven days upon returning home, making a total of ten days of fasting. These provisions are specifically for those whose families are not residing near al-Masjid al-Haram (the Sacred Mosque in Mecca). The verse concludes by reminding believers to fear Allah and be aware that Allah's punishment is severe for those who disobey His commands.

Verse 197:
"The Hajj is [during] well-known months, so whoever has made Hajj obligatory upon himself therein [by entering the state of ihram], there is [to be for him] no sexual relations and no disobedience and no disputing during Hajj. And whatever good you do - Allah knows it. And take provisions, but indeed, the best provision is fear of Allah. So fear Me, O you of understanding."

This verse emphasizes the sanctity of the months in which Hajj is performed and instructs those who have entered the state of ihram (ritual consecration) for Hajj to abstain from sexual relations, disobedience, and disputes during the pilgrimage.

It encourages believers to be conscious of Allah and seek understanding of His guidance.

Verse 198:
"There is no blame upon you for seeking bounty from your Lord [during Hajj]. But when you depart from 'Arafat, remember Allah at al-Mash'ar al-Haram. And remember Him, as He has guided you, for indeed, you were before that among those astray."

This verse addresses the permissibility of seeking provision and sustenance from Allah during the Hajj pilgrimage. It assures believers that there is no blame upon them for seeking the blessings and favors of their Lord. However, it also reminds them that after departing from the gathering at 'Arafat, they should remember Allah and engage in acts of worship and remembrance at al-Mash'ar al-Haram (a designated site near Muzdalifah). The verse highlights the importance of reflecting upon Allah's guidance and the transformation that has taken place in the lives of the pilgrims who were previously astray but have now been guided to the right path through Hajj.

Verse 210:

Verse 213:
"Mankind was [of] one religion [before their deviation]; then Allah sent the prophets as bringers of good tidings and warners and sent down with them the Scripture in truth to judge between the people concerning that in which they differed. And none differed over the Scripture except those who were given it - after the clear proofs came to them - out of jealous animosity among themselves. And Allah guided those who believed to the truth concerning that over which they had differed, by His permission. And Allah guides whom He wills to a straight path."

This verse highlights the original unity of mankind in following a single religion before they deviated and diverged into various belief systems. Allah, out of His mercy and wisdom, sent prophets as bearers of good news and warning, along with revelations in the form of Scriptures, to guide and judge between people in matters of disagreement. The verse points out that those who differed in their interpretations of the Scriptures were primarily those who received them, driven by jealous animosity among themselves. However, Allah, by His permission, guided the believers to the truth and resolved their differences. It emphasizes that it is Allah who guides whom He wills onto the straight path.

Verse 214:
"Or do you think that you will enter Paradise while such [trial] has not yet come to you as came to those who passed on before you? They were touched by poverty and hardship and were shaken until [even their] messenger and those who believed with him said, 'When is the help of Allah?' Unquestionably, the help of Allah is near."

This verse discusses the topic of fighting and highlights the complex nature of human desires and preferences. It acknowledges that although fighting may be disliked or hateful to some, there are situations where it becomes necessary and beneficial.

The verse encourages believers to trust in Allah's wisdom and guidance, even if they may not fully comprehend the wisdom behind certain actions or circumstances.

Verse 217:

And fitnah is greater than killing.' And they will continue to fight you until they turn you back from your religion if they are able. And whoever of you reverts from his religion [to disbelief] and dies while he is a disbeliever - for those, their deeds have become worthless in this world and the Hereafter, and those are the companions of the Fire, they will abide therein eternally."

This verse addresses a question concerning the sacred months and the permissibility of fighting during them. The response clarifies that although fighting during the sacred months is a grave sin, there are even greater sins in the sight of Allah.

It emphasizes that the greatest trial and temptation (fitnah) is worse than killing.

Verse 220:
"Upon the world and the Hereafter. And they ask you about orphans. Say, 'Improvement for them is best. And if you mix your affairs with theirs - they are your brothers.

Allah is exalted in might and possesses perfect wisdom.

Verse 221:

And their husbands have more right to take them back in this [period] if they want reconciliation. And due to the wives is similar to what is expected of them, according to what is reasonable. But the men have a degree over them [in responsibility and authority]. And Allah is Exalted in Might and Wise."

This verse addresses the waiting period (iddah) for divorced women. It stipulates that divorced women must observe a waiting period of three menstrual cycles before they can marry again.

"Divorce is twice. Then, either keep [her] in an acceptable manner or release [her] with good treatment. And it is not lawful for you to take anything of what you have given them unless both fear that they will not be able to keep [within] the limits of Allah. But if you fear that they will not keep [within] the limits of Allah, then there is no blame upon either of them concerning that by which she ransoms herself. These are the limits of Allah, so do not transgress them. And whoever transgresses the limits of Allah - it is those who are the wrongdoers."

This verse addresses the concept of divorce and outlines the rules and regulations associated with it. It states that divorce can be pronounced twice in a marital relationship.

The verse underscores the importance of respecting the limits of Allah and warns against transgressing them. Those who exceed these limits are considered wrongdoers.

Verse 230:
"And if he has divorced her [for the third time], then she is not lawful to him afterward until [after] she marries a husband other than him. But if the latter husband divorces her [or dies], there is no blame upon them [i.e., the former husband and wife] if they return to each other, provided they think that they can keep [within] the limits of Allah. These are the limits of Allah, which He makes clear to a people who know."

This verse continues the discussion on divorce, specifically addressing the issue of the third and final divorce. It states that if a husband has divorced his wife three times, she becomes impermissible for him to remarry unless she marries another husband in a legitimate marriage and they consummate their relationship. However, if the second husband divorces her or passes away, there is no blame on the former husband and wife if they decide to reunite, provided they believe they can uphold the boundaries and obligations set by Allah. This verse emphasizes the importance of considering the consequences of divorce and encourages reconciliation whenever possible.

Verse 231:
"And when you divorce women and they have [nearly] fulfilled their term, either retain them according to acceptable terms or release them according to acceptable terms, and do not keep them, intending harm, to transgress [against them]. And whoever does that has certainly wronged himself. And do not take the verses of Allah in jest. And remember the favor of Allah upon you and what has been revealed to you of the Book and wisdom by which He instructs you. And fear Allah and know that Allah is Knowing of all things."

This verse provides guidance on the treatment of divorced women, particularly when they are approaching the end of their waiting period. It advises that during this time, the husband should either retain them in a kind and fair manner or release them amicably, without intending any harm or ill treatment. It warns against using divorce as a means to oppress or mistreat women. Those who do so are considered to have wronged themselves. The verse also emphasizes the seriousness of Allah's verses and teachings, urging believers to reflect on the favors of Allah and the wisdom revealed in the Book (Quran). It reminds them to fear Allah and be aware that He is knowledgeable of all things.

Verse 232:
"And when you divorce women and they have fulfilled their term, do not prevent them from remarrying their [former] husbands if they agree among themselves on an acceptable basis. That is instructed to whoever of you believes in Allah and the Last Day. That is better for you and purer, and Allah knows and you know not."

This verse addresses the issue of preventing divorced women from remarrying their former husbands once their waiting period (iddah) is completed. It advises that if both parties mutually agree on an acceptable basis, they should not be prevented from remarrying. This instruction is given to those who believe in Allah and the Last Day. The verse emphasizes that allowing such remarriage is better and purer for them. It reminds the believers that Allah's knowledge surpasses their own, and they may not fully understand the wisdom behind certain rulings.

Verse 233:
"Mothers may breastfeed their children two complete years for whoever wishes to complete the nursing [period]. Upon the father is the mothers' provision and their clothing according to what is acceptable. No person is charged with more than his capacity. No mother should be harmed through her child, and no father through his child. And upon the [father's] heir is [a duty] like that [of the father]. And if they both desire weaning through mutual consent from both of them and consultation, there is no blame upon either of them. And if you wish to have your children nursed by a substitute, there is no blame upon you as long as you give payment according to what is acceptable. And fear Allah and know that Allah is Seeing of what you do."

This verse addresses the topic of breastfeeding and provides guidance regarding the period of nursing for children. It states that mothers should breastfeed their children for a complete period of two years if they wish to do so. During this time, it is the responsibility of the father to provide for the mother's needs and clothing in a manner that is acceptable and fair. The verse emphasizes that no one should be burdened with more than they can handle, and no mother or father should be harmed or burdened through the care of their child. The verse also recognizes the importance of mutual consent and consultation between parents when deciding to wean their child. If both parents agree to wean the child before the completion of two years, there is no blame on either of them. Additionally, the verse allows for the option of hiring a substitute mother for breastfeeding, as long as the payment is made in accordance with what is acceptable. The verse concludes by reminding believers to fear Allah and be mindful that He sees their actions.

Verse 234:
"And those who are taken in death among you and leave wives behind - they, [the wives, shall] wait four months and ten [days]. And when they have fulfilled their term, then there is no blame upon you for what they do with themselves in an acceptable manner. And Allah is [fully] acquainted with what you do."

But do not promise them secretly except for saying a proper saying. And do not determine to undertake a marriage contract until the decreed period reaches its end. And know that Allah knows what is within yourselves, so beware of Him. And know that Allah is Forgiving and Forbearing."

This verse addresses the issue of expressing interest in marriage and making proposals to women. It states that there is no blame on individuals for subtly alluding to their interest in marriage or for keeping their intentions within themselves. Allah is aware of what individuals have in mind.

And to forego it is nearer to righteousness. And do not forget graciousness between you. Indeed Allah, of whatever you do, is Seeing."

This verse addresses the issue of divorce before consummation of the marriage when an obligation or dowry has been specified. It states that if a divorce occurs before the husband has intimate relations with his wife and an obligation or dowry has been set, the husband should give half of what was specified, unless the wife willingly foregoes her right or the one holding the marriage contract foregoes it.

He said, 'Would you perhaps refrain from fighting if fighting was prescribed for you?' They said, 'And why should we not fight in the cause of Allah when we have been driven out from our homes and from our children?' But when fighting was prescribed for them, they turned away, except for a few of them. And Allah is Knowing of the wrongdoers."

This verse mentions an incident from the history of the Children of Israel. They had requested a prophet to appoint a king for them, with the intention of fighting in the cause of Allah. However, when the opportunity for battle came, most of them turned away and refused to fight, except for a few individuals. The verse highlights their hypocrisy and lack of commitment to their initial claim. It emphasizes that Allah is aware of those who commit wrongdoing and fail to fulfill their promises.

Verse 247:
"Their prophet said to them, 'Indeed, Allah has sent to you Saul as a king.' They said, 'How can he have kingship over us while we are more worthy of kingship than him and he has not been given any measure of wealth?' He said, 'Indeed, Allah has chosen him over you and has increased him abundantly in knowledge and stature.' And Allah gives His sovereignty to whom He wills. And Allah is all-Encompassing [in favor] and Knowing."

This verse continues the narration of the incident mentioned in the previous verse. The prophet appointed Saul as their king by the command of Allah.

The verse suggests that this event serves as a sign for them to recognize and affirm Saul's legitimacy as their king if they are truly believers.

Verse 249:
"And when Saul set out with the soldiers, he said, 'Indeed, Allah will be testing you with a river. So whoever drinks from it is not of me, and whoever does not taste it is indeed of me, excepting one who takes [from it] in the hollow of his hand.' But they drank from it, except a [very] few of them. Then when he had crossed it along with those who believed with him, they said, 'There is no power for us today against Goliath and his soldiers.' But those who were certain that they would meet Allah said, 'How many a small company has overcome a large company by permission of Allah. And Allah is with the patient.'"

This verse tells the story of Saul (Talut) and his army facing a test from Allah. Saul informed his soldiers that they would be tested with a river. Whoever drinks from it will not be considered part of his army, except for those who take only a small amount of water in the hollow of their hands. However, most of the soldiers failed the test and drank from the river. Only a few remained who did not consume from it. As they proceeded, the soldiers who had failed the test lost hope in their ability to face Goliath and his soldiers. However, those who were certain in their faith and believed in meeting Allah remained steadfast and reminded themselves of the countless instances where a small group had overcome a larger one with the permission of Allah. They understood that Allah is with the patient and steadfast believers.

Verse 250:
"And when they went forth to [face] Goliath and his soldiers, they said, 'Our Lord, pour upon us patience and plant firmly our feet and give us victory over the disbelieving people.'"

They are recited to him in truth, serving as a guidance for all humanity.

Verse 253:
"Those messengers - some of them We caused to exceed others. Among them were those to whom Allah spoke, and He raised some of them in degree. And We gave Jesus, the Son of Mary, clear proofs, and We supported him with the Pure Spirit. If Allah had willed, those [generations] succeeding them would not have fought each other after the clear proofs had come to them. But they differed, and some of them believed and some of them disbelieved. And if Allah had willed, they would not have fought each other, but Allah does what He intends."

This verse discusses the variation in the ranks and levels of the messengers of Allah. Allah raised some of them in rank and gave them special privileges.

Allah affirms that He has the power to prevent such conflicts, but He allows free will and the consequences of people's choices to unfold according to His divine plan.

Verse 254:
"O you who have believed, spend from that which We have provided for you before there comes a Day in which there is no exchange and no friendship and no intercession. And the disbelievers - they are the wrongdoers."

This verse addresses the believers, urging them to spend from the provisions and blessings that Allah has bestowed upon them in acts of charity and goodness. It emphasizes the transient nature of worldly possessions and the importance of using them for the sake of Allah before the arrival of a Day of Judgment where no transactions, friendships, or intercessions will be of any avail. The verse also highlights that those who disbelieve are in the wrong and engage in wrongdoing by rejecting the truth and disregarding the importance of spending in the way of Allah.

Verse 255, Ayat al-Kursi (The Throne Verse):
"Allah! There is no deity except Him, the Ever-Living, the Sustainer of existence. Neither drowsiness overtakes Him nor sleep. To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. Who is it that can intercede with Him except by His permission? He knows what is before them and what will be after them, and they encompass not a thing of His knowledge except for what He wills. His Kursi extends over the heavens and the earth, and their preservation tires Him not. And He is the Most High, the Most Great."

This verse, known as Ayat al-Kursi, is a profound declaration of the greatness and sovereignty of Allah. It asserts that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allah, who is the Ever-Living and the Sustainer of all existence. Allah does not experience drowsiness or sleep, and everything in the heavens and the earth belongs to Him. No one can intercede with Him except with His permission, and He possesses complete knowledge of the past, present, and future. The verse emphasizes the vastness of Allah's dominion, extending over the entire universe, yet His preservation of it does not exhaust Him. Allah is described as the Most High and the Most Great, signifying His unmatched greatness and authority.

Verses 256-257:
"There shall be no compulsion in [acceptance of] the religion. The right course has become clear from the wrong. So whoever disbelieves in Taghut and believes in Allah has grasped the most trustworthy handhold with no break in it. And Allah is Hearing and Knowing. Allah is the ally of those who believe. He brings them out from darknesses into the light. And those who disbelieve - their allies are Taghut. They take them out of the light into darknesses. Those are the companions of the Fire; they will abide eternally therein."

These verses emphasize the principle of freedom of religion and choice. It is stated that there should be no compulsion or coercion in matters of faith. The truth is made distinct from falsehood, and it is up to individuals to choose the right path. Those who reject false deities (Taghut) and believe in Allah have firmly grasped the most reliable and unbreakable support. Allah, who is All-Hearing and All-Knowing, is the protector and ally of the believers. He guides them from the darkness of disbelief into the light of faith. Conversely, those who associate themselves with false deities and disbelieve are guided away from the light into darkness. They are the companions of the Fire, destined for eternal punishment.
