This verse calls upon all of humanity to be conscious of their Lord and to fear Allah. It reminds us that Allah is the Creator of all mankind, originating from one soul (Adam) and then diversifying into many nations and tribes. It emphasizes the importance of being mindful of Allah in our interactions with one another, as well as recognizing the sanctity of the wombs (i.e., the family bonds). The verse also highlights that Allah is constantly watching over us.

Verse 2: "And give to the orphans their properties and do not substitute the defective [of your own] for the good [of theirs]. And do not consume their properties into your own. Indeed, that is ever a great sin."

This verse instructs believers to fulfill the rights of orphans by safeguarding and managing their properties responsibly. It emphasizes the importance of not taking advantage of their vulnerable situation or mixing their wealth with one's own. It warns against consuming their properties unjustly, as it is a grave sin.

Verse 3: "And if you fear that you will not deal justly with the orphan girls, then marry those that please you of [other] women, two or three or four. But if you fear that you will not be just, then [marry only] one or those your right hand possesses. That is more suitable that you may not incline [to injustice]."

This verse addresses the issue of polygamy and provides guidance on the topic. It states that if one fears not being able to treat orphan girls with fairness and equality in marriage, then they may marry other women who are permissible to them, up to a maximum of four wives. However, it advises that if one fears not being able to maintain justice among multiple wives, then it is better to marry only one wife or consider marrying from among those whom their right hands possess (i.e., slaves or captives), as long as it is done with justice and respect.

Verse 4: "And give the women [upon marriage] their [bridal] gifts graciously. But if they give up willingly to you anything of it, then take it in satisfaction and ease."

This verse addresses the issue of dowry (bridal gifts) given to women upon marriage. It instructs men to give these gifts to women generously and without any reluctance. However, it also allows for women to willingly give up a portion or all of their dowry if they choose to do so, and in such cases, men should accept it graciously.


Verse 5: "And do not give the weak-minded your property, which Allah has made a means of sustenance for you, but provide for them with it and clothe them and speak to them words of appropriate kindness."

This verse advises against entrusting one's property to those who are mentally deficient or incapable of managing it. Instead, it emphasizes the responsibility of taking care of such individuals, providing for their needs, clothing them, and speaking to them with kind and appropriate words. This highlights the importance of compassion and proper treatment towards vulnerable members of society.

Verse 6: "And test the orphans [in their abilities] until they reach marriageable age. Then if you perceive in them sound judgment, release their property to them. And do not consume it excessively and quickly, [anticipating] that they will grow up. And whoever, [when acting as guardian], is self-sufficient should refrain [from taking an inheritance]. And whoever is poor - let him take according to what is acceptable. Then when you release their property to them, bring witnesses upon them. And sufficient is Allah as Accountant."

This verse addresses the guardianship and management of orphan's wealth. It instructs that orphans should be tested in their abilities and maturity until they reach a marriageable age. If they demonstrate sound judgment and responsibility, their wealth should be released to them. Guardians are cautioned against consuming or exploiting the orphan's property excessively or for personal gain. It also encourages those guardians who are financially stable to refrain from taking any portion of the orphan's inheritance. Those who are in need, however, may take a reasonable amount for their own sustenance. When releasing the wealth to the orphans, witnesses should be present as a means of accountability, and ultimately, Allah is the ultimate Accountant who oversees all matters.

Verse 7: "For men is a share of what the parents and close relatives leave, and for women is a share of what the parents and close relatives leave, be it little or much - an obligatory share."

This verse addresses the issue of inheritance and emphasizes that both men and women have a right to receive a share of the inheritance left by their parents and close relatives. The share allocated to each gender may vary depending on the specific circumstances, but it highlights the obligation to provide a fair and just distribution of inheritance to both men and women.

Verse 8: "And when [other] relatives and orphans and the needy are present at the [time of] division, then provide for them [something] out of the estate and speak to them words of appropriate kindness."

This verse emphasizes the importance of considering the presence of other relatives, orphans, and the needy at the time of distributing the inheritance. It instructs the inheritors to provide for them from the estate and to treat them with kindness and compassion. This highlights the Islamic principle of caring for the less fortunate and ensuring that they are included in the distribution of wealth.

Verse 9: "And let those [executors and guardians] fear [injustice] as if they [themselves] had left weak offspring behind and feared for them. So let them fear Allah and speak words of appropriate justice."

This verse advises executors and guardians who are responsible for distributing the inheritance to act with utmost fairness and justice. They are urged to imagine the situation as if they themselves had left behind vulnerable children and were concerned about their well-being. It emphasizes the fear of Allah and the importance of speaking words of justice and equity in all matters related to inheritance.

Verse 9: "And let those [executors and guardians] fear [injustice] as if they [themselves] had left weak offspring behind and feared for them. So let them fear Allah and speak words of appropriate justice."

They are urged to imagine the situation as if they themselves had left behind vulnerable children and were concerned about their well-being.

Verse 10: "Indeed, those who devour the property of orphans unjustly are only consuming into their bellies fire. And they will be burned in a Blaze."

This verse warns against those who unjustly consume the wealth of orphans. It likens their actions to consuming fire, indicating the severe consequences they will face in the Hereafter, where they will be punished in the Hellfire.

Verse 11: "Allah instructs you concerning your children: for the male, what is equal to the share of two females. But if there are [only] daughters, two or more, for them is two-thirds of one's estate. And if there is only one, for her is half. And for one's parents, to each one of them is a sixth of his estate if he left children. But if he had no children and the parents [alone] inherit from him, then for his mother is one-third. And if he had brothers [or sisters], for his mother is a sixth, after any bequest he [may have] made or debt. Your parents or your children - you know not which of them are nearest to you in benefit. [These shares are] an obligation [imposed] by Allah. Indeed, Allah is ever Knowing and Wise."

This verse provides guidance on the division of inheritance among family members. It outlines specific shares for different relatives based on gender and relationship. It establishes that male heirs are entitled to a portion equal to that of two female heirs. In cases where there are only daughters, they are to receive two-thirds of the estate. If there is only one daughter, she is entitled to half. As for parents, each parent receives one-sixth of the deceased's estate if the deceased has left behind children. In the absence of children, but with the presence of parents, the mother receives one-third, and if there are siblings, the mother's share becomes one-sixth. However, it is important to note that these shares are subject to adjustments based on any bequests or debts left behind by the deceased. This verse reminds believers that the division of inheritance is a divine obligation from Allah, and He is All-Knowing and Wise.

Verse 12: "And you will never be able to be equal [in feeling] between wives, even if you should strive [to do so]. So do not incline completely [toward one] and leave another hanging. And if you amend [your affairs] and fear Allah - then indeed, Allah is ever Forgiving and Merciful."

This verse addresses the issue of polygamy and acknowledges that it is not possible to maintain absolute equality in feelings and emotions between multiple wives. However, it advises believers not to show complete favoritism towards one wife while neglecting the others. It encourages spouses to strive for fairness and equitable treatment. If they strive for rectification and fear Allah, seeking His forgiveness and mercy, they can maintain a harmonious marital relationship.

Verse 13: "But if they separate [by divorce], Allah will enrich each [of them] from His abundance. And ever is Allah Encompassing and Wise."

This verse reassures those who go through divorce that Allah will provide for each of them abundantly from His infinite resources. It reminds believers that Allah's wisdom and knowledge encompass all matters, including the outcomes of divorce.


Verse 14: "And to Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. And We have instructed those who were given the Scripture before you and yourselves to fear Allah. But if you disbelieve - then to Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. And ever is Allah Free of need and Praiseworthy."

This verse emphasizes that everything in the heavens and the earth belongs to Allah. It highlights that Allah has given guidance to those who were previously given the Scriptures (previous nations) and to the present community (Muslims) to fear Him and follow His commandments. However, if people choose to disbelieve, it does not diminish Allah's ownership and control over everything. Allah is completely self-sufficient and worthy of all praise.

Verse 15: "Indeed, those who conceal what We sent down of clear proofs and guidance after We made it clear for the people in the Scripture - those are cursed by Allah and cursed by those who curse."

This verse refers to those who intentionally hide or distort the clear signs and guidance that Allah has revealed. It specifically addresses the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) who were entrusted with divine revelations prior to the advent of Islam. Those who conceal or manipulate these revelations, despite their clarity, incur the curse of Allah and the curse of those who invoke curses.

Verse 16: "Except for those who repent and correct themselves and make evident [what they concealed]. Those - I will accept their repentance, and I am the Accepting of repentance, the Merciful."

This verse provides hope and mercy. It states that those who repent sincerely, rectify their conduct, and openly acknowledge the truth they previously concealed, Allah will accept their repentance. Allah is described as the Acceptor of repentance and the Merciful, highlighting His forgiveness and willingness to pardon those who genuinely seek His forgiveness.

Verse 17: "Indeed, those who disbelieve and die while they are disbelievers - upon them will be the curse of Allah and of the angels and the people, all together."

This verse emphasizes the severe consequences for those who persist in disbelief until their death. Such individuals will be subject to the curse of Allah, the angels, and all of humanity. It underscores the gravity of rejecting the truth and remaining in a state of disbelief.

Verse 18: "Abiding eternally therein. The punishment will not be lightened for them, nor will they be reprieved."

This verse explains that those who receive the curse of Allah, the angels, and people will dwell in a state of eternal punishment in the Hereafter. Their torment will not be lessened, nor will they be granted any respite or reprieve from it.

Verse 19: "And your Lord is the Forgiving, Full of Mercy. If He were to impose blame upon them for what they earned, He would have hastened for them the punishment. But for them is an appointment from which they will never find an escape."

This verse reminds believers that despite the severity of Allah's punishment for those who persist in disbelief, Allah is also the Forgiving and Merciful. If Allah were to hasten the punishment for people's wrongdoings, they would have no opportunity for repentance and redemption. However, there is an appointed time for every individual, and once that time comes, there will be no escape from the consequences of their actions.


Verse 20: "But those who associate others with Allah say, 'If Allah had willed, we would not have worshipped anything other than Him, neither we nor our fathers, nor would we have forbidden anything through other than Him.' Thus did those before them deny until they tasted Our punishment. Say, 'Do you have any knowledge that you can produce for us? Indeed, you follow not except assumption, and you are not but falsifying.'"

This verse addresses the polytheists who associate partners with Allah. They claim that if Allah had willed, they would not have worshiped anything besides Him, nor would they have prohibited certain things unless He commanded them to do so. The verse highlights their denial and rejection of the truth, similar to those who came before them and were ultimately subjected to divine punishment. The believers are instructed to challenge the polytheists to produce any knowledge or evidence to support their claims, as their beliefs are based on mere assumptions and falsehoods.

Verse 21: "Say, 'The [decision concerning] death and life is for Allah.' Then He will inform you of what you used to do."

This verse reminds the believers to acknowledge that Allah alone has control over life and death. It emphasizes that Allah will eventually inform them of their deeds and actions in the Hereafter, where they will be held accountable for their choices and conduct.

Verse 22: "And it is He who created you from one soul and made from it its mate that he might dwell in security with her. And when he covers her, she carries a light burden and continues therein. And when it becomes heavy, they both invoke Allah, their Lord, 'If You should give us a good [child], we will surely be among the grateful.'"

This verse highlights the creation of human beings and the establishment of marriage. It reminds us that Allah created humans from a single soul (Adam) and then created his mate (Eve) from him to form the institution of marriage. The verse describes the mutual support and comfort between spouses, particularly during pregnancy, where the wife carries the growing child as a light burden. In times of difficulty, both spouses turn to Allah, seeking His blessings and expressing gratitude, with the hope of having a righteous and healthy child.

Verse 23: "But when He gives them a good [child], they ascribe partners to Him concerning that which He has given them. Exalted is Allah above what they associate with Him."

This verse highlights the ingratitude and ignorance of some people who, after being blessed with a good child, attribute partners to Allah in relation to that child. It reminds us that Allah is free from any partners or associates, and He alone deserves to be worshipped and praised for the blessings bestowed upon us.

Verse 24: "Do they associate with Him those who create nothing and they are [themselves] created?"

This verse questions the polytheists who associate partners with Allah. It challenges their belief in deities or objects that have no power of creation themselves and are, in fact, created beings just like them. It invites them to reflect on the irrationality of their beliefs and to recognize the supremacy of Allah as the sole Creator.


Verse 25: "And those who disbelieve say, 'The life of this world is only amusement and diversion, and indeed, the home of the Hereafter - that is the [eternal] life, if only they knew.'"

This verse portrays the perspective of the disbelievers who perceive worldly life as mere amusement and diversion, devoid of any higher purpose. However, it highlights that the true essence of life lies in the eternal abode of the Hereafter. The verse suggests that if they had true knowledge and understanding, they would realize the importance of focusing on the life to come.

Verse 26: "But when they board a ship, they supplicate Allah, sincere to Him in religion. But when He delivers them to the land, at once they associate others with Him."

This verse portrays the inconsistent behavior of some individuals. When they are in a state of danger, such as being on a ship in the midst of a storm, they sincerely turn to Allah alone, supplicating to Him with devotion and faith. However, once they are safely delivered to land, they revert to associating partners with Allah, attributing blessings to other entities besides Him. This inconsistency in their belief and behavior is highlighted.

Verse 27: "So that they will deny what We have granted them, and they will enjoy themselves. But they are going to know."

This verse reveals that people who associate partners with Allah often deny His blessings and attribute them to other causes. They indulge in worldly enjoyment without acknowledging that it is ultimately a result of Allah's favors. However, the verse reminds them that they will eventually come to know the truth and face the consequences of their disbelief and ingratitude.

Verse 28: "Have they not seen that We made [Makkah] a safe sanctuary, while people are being taken away all around them? Then in falsehood do they believe, and in the favor of Allah they disbelieve?"

This verse draws attention to the people's lack of observation and understanding. They fail to recognize the miraculous nature of the sacred sanctuary of Makkah, which was made a place of safety and security amidst a surrounding world filled with conflicts and upheavals. Despite witnessing this divine favor, they choose to believe in falsehoods and deny the favors bestowed upon them by Allah.

Verse 29: "And who is more unjust than one who invents a lie about Allah or says, 'It has been inspired to me,' while nothing has been inspired to him, and one who says, 'I will reveal [something] like what Allah revealed.' And if you could but see when the wrongdoers are in the overwhelming pangs of death while the angels extend their hands, [saying], 'Discharge your souls! Today you will be awarded the punishment of [extreme] humiliation for what you used to say against Allah other than the truth and [that] you were, toward His verses, being arrogant.'"

This verse addresses the grave injustice committed by those who fabricate lies about Allah, claim to receive divine inspiration when they haven't, or arrogantly assert that they can produce revelations similar to those of Allah. The verse vividly describes the moment of death for such wrongdoers when they are overwhelmed by the pain and anguish. At that critical juncture, the angels extend their hands to extract their souls, while delivering the humiliating punishment for their false claims against Allah and their arrogance in rejecting His true revelations.

Verse 30: "And those who were given knowledge see that what is revealed to you from your Lord is the truth, and it guides to the path of the Exalted in Might, the Praiseworthy."

This verse highlights the recognition of the people of knowledge, who acknowledge and affirm that the revelations sent to the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) are the truth from their Lord. They understand that these revelations guide humanity to the path of Allah, the Exalted in Might, and worthy of all praise.

Verse 31: "But those who disbelieve say, 'Shall we direct you to a man who will inform you [that] when you have disintegrated in complete disintegration, you will [then] be [recreated] in a new creation?'"

This verse depicts the disbelief of certain individuals who mockingly question the possibility of resurrection and the concept of being recreated after complete disintegration. They sarcastically suggest that someone will inform them about such a notion. This verse serves as a response to those who deny the concept of the Hereafter and the resurrection of the dead.

Verse 32: "Has he invented about Allah a lie or is there in him madness?' Rather, they who do not believe in the Hereafter will be in the punishment and [are in] extreme error."

This verse addresses the doubts raised by disbelievers regarding the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and the authenticity of his message. It refutes their accusations, asserting that the Prophet is neither inventing lies about Allah nor is he insane. It clarifies that those who deny the Hereafter and reject the message of Islam will face punishment in the Hereafter and are deeply misguided in their disbelief.

Verse 33: "Then, do they not look at the heaven above them - how We structured it and adorned it and [how] it has no rifts?"

This verse invites people to contemplate the heavens above them as a means of recognizing the greatness of Allah's creation. It draws attention to the perfect structure and adornment of the sky, emphasizing that it is flawlessly designed without any imperfections or rifts. This serves as a reflection on Allah's power and wisdom.

Verse 34: "And the earth - We have spread it out and cast therein firmly set mountains and caused to grow therein [something] of every well-balanced thing."

This verse directs attention to the earth and its remarkable features. It highlights the vastness and expansive nature of the earth, as well as the presence of firmly rooted mountains that stabilize it. Additionally, it acknowledges the diverse and well-balanced creation that exists on the earth, emphasizing Allah's wisdom and providence.

Verse 35: "And We have made for you therein means of living and [for] those for whom you are not providers."

This verse acknowledges that Allah has provided sustenance and means of livelihood on earth, both for humans and for other creatures. It recognizes that while humans may provide for themselves and their families, there are also living beings for whom humans are not the direct providers, yet they are still provided for by Allah.

Verse 36: "And there is not a creature on earth but that upon Allah is its provision, and He knows its place of dwelling and place of storage. All is in a clear register."

This verse emphasizes that every living creature on earth relies on Allah for its sustenance and provision. Allah has complete knowledge of each creature's habitat, dwelling place, and even its hidden storage places. Everything is meticulously recorded and accounted for in a clear register, highlighting Allah's all-encompassing knowledge and control.


Verse 37: "Who are stingy and enjoin upon people stinginess and conceal what Allah has given them of His bounty - and We have prepared for the disbelievers a humiliating punishment."

This verse describes the behavior of those who are miserly and encourage others to be the same. They hoard and conceal the blessings and bounties bestowed upon them by Allah, refusing to share them with others. The verse warns that such individuals, who display ingratitude and selfishness, will face a humiliating punishment in the Hereafter.

Verse 38: "And [also] those who spend of their wealth to be seen by the people and believe not in Allah nor in the Last Day. And he to whom Satan is a companion - then evil is he as a companion."

This verse addresses those who spend their wealth solely to gain recognition and praise from people, without genuine belief in Allah or the Hereafter. It condemns their insincerity and warns that associating with Satan and following his path is indeed an evil and detrimental companionship.

Verse 39: "And what would be the matter with them that they should believe in Allah and the Last Day and spend out of what Allah has provided for them? And Allah is Knowing of them."

This verse questions the reasons behind the disbelief and reluctance of certain individuals to believe in Allah, the Last Day, and spend their wealth in the way Allah has ordained. It highlights that Allah has complete knowledge of their intentions and actions.

Verse 40: "Indeed, Allah does not do injustice, [even] as much as an atom's weight; while if there is a good deed, He multiplies it and gives from Himself a great reward."

This verse reassures that Allah is completely just and fair. He does not commit even the slightest injustice, not even the weight of an atom. On the contrary, Allah multiplies the reward for every good deed and bestows upon the believers an abundant and generous reward from Himself.

Verse 41: "So how [will it be] when We bring from every nation a witness and we bring you, [O Muhammad], against these [people] as a witness?"

This verse alludes to the future event when Allah will bring forth witnesses from every nation, testifying to their deeds and actions. Additionally, the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) will be brought as a witness against those who rejected his message and opposed the truth.

This verse describes a scene on the Day of Judgment, where the hypocrites, both men and women, will seek to benefit from the light of the believers. However, they will be rejected and told to go back and seek light for themselves. A barrier will be erected between the two groups, with a door that opens to mercy for the believers, while the hypocrites will be left outside, destined for punishment.

Verse 43: "The hypocrites will call to the believers, 'Were we not with you?' They will say, 'Yes, but you afflicted yourselves and awaited [misfortune for us] and doubted, and wishful thinking deluded you until there came the command of Allah. And the Deceiver deceived you concerning Allah.'"

In this verse, the hypocrites will try to claim that they were part of the believers' community.

If only You had postponed [it for] us for a short time.' Say, The enjoyment of this world is little, and the Hereafter is better for he who fears Allah. And injustice will not be done to you, [even] as much as a thread [inside a date seed].'"

So what is [the matter] with those people that they can hardly understand any statement?"

It highlights the tendency of some people to attribute good fortune to Allah but hold others responsible for any adversity they face. The verse instructs the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) to convey that all things, whether good or bad, ultimately come from Allah. It questions the inability of some individuals to comprehend this simple truth and the reasons behind their lack of understanding.

Verse 79 of Surah An-Nisa' (4:79):
"What comes to you of good is from Allah, but what comes to you of evil, [O man], is from yourself. And We have sent you, [O Muhammad], to the people as a messenger, and sufficient is Allah as Witness."

This verse questions the division among the believers regarding the hypocrites. It points out that Allah has caused the hypocrites to regress into disbelief due to their own actions. The verse challenges the believers, asking if they seek to guide those whom Allah has already led astray. It emphasizes that those whom Allah has sent astray will never find a way of guidance. The verse encourages the believers to focus on their own faith and not be excessively preoccupied with the guidance of the hypocrites who have chosen to turn away from the truth.

Verse 89: "They wish you would disbelieve as they disbelieved so you would be alike. So do not take from among them allies until they emigrate for the cause of Allah. But if they turn away, then seize them and kill them wherever you find them and take not from among them any ally or helper."

This verse addresses the context of the early Muslim community, where there were some disbelievers who wished for the Prophet Muhammad and the believers to abandon their faith. The verse advises the Muslims not to take the disbelievers as allies or protectors unless they embrace Islam and migrate for the sake of Allah. However, if they persist in their disbelief and hostility, then the Muslims are allowed to fight against them in self-defense until they cease their aggression.

Verse 90: "Except for those who take refuge with a people between yourselves and whom is a treaty or those who come to you, their hearts strained at [the prospect of] fighting you or fighting their own people. And if Allah had willed, He could have given them power over you, and they would have fought you. So if they remove themselves from you and do not fight you and offer you peace, then Allah has not made for you a cause [for fighting] against them."

This verse provides exceptions to the previous command by stating that those who seek refuge with a people who have a peace treaty with the Muslims or those who approach the Muslims with fear and reluctance to fight them or their own people should not be fought against. If they choose to disengage from hostility and offer peace, then there is no justification for fighting them, as Allah has not given the Muslims a cause to fight against such individuals.

Verse 91: "You will find others who wish to obtain security from you and [to] obtain security from their people. Every time they are returned to [the influence of] disbelief, they fall back into it. So if they do not withdraw from you or offer you peace or restrain their hands, then seize them and kill them wherever you overtake them. And those - We have made for you against them a clear authorization."

This verse refers to a group of people who pretend to seek peace and security from the Muslims while secretly maintaining their allegiance to disbelief. They continuously revert to disbelief whenever they are exposed to it. If such individuals do not withdraw, offer peace, or restrain their aggression, the Muslims are instructed to seize and fight against them wherever they encounter them. Allah has granted the Muslims a clear authorization to defend themselves against those who pose a threat.

Verse 92: "And it is not for a believer to kill a believer except by mistake. And whoever kills a believer by mistake - then the freeing of a believing slave and a compensation payment presented to the deceased's family [is required] unless they give [up their right as] charity. But if the deceased was from a people at war with you and he was a believer - then [only] the freeing of a believing slave. And if he was from a people with whom you have a treaty - then a compensation payment presented to his family and the freeing of a believing slave. And whoever does not find [one or cannot afford to buy one] - then [instead], a fast for two months consecutively, [seeking] acceptance of repentance from Allah. And Allah is ever Knowing and Wise."

This verse addresses the accidental killing of a believer by another believer. In such cases, the person responsible for the accidental killing must free a believing slave and provide compensation to the deceased's family, unless the family chooses to forgive and forgo their right to compensation. However, if the deceased was

Verse 92: "And it is not for a believer to kill a believer except by mistake. And whoever kills a believer by mistake - then the freeing of a believing slave and a compensation payment presented to the deceased's family [is required] unless they give [up their right as] charity. But if the deceased was from a people at war with you and he was a believer - then [only] the freeing of a believing slave. And if he was from a people with whom you have a treaty - then a compensation payment presented to his family and the freeing of a believing slave. And whoever does not find [one or cannot afford to buy one] - then [instead], a fast for two months consecutively, [seeking] acceptance of repentance from Allah. And Allah is ever Knowing and Wise."

This verse addresses the situation of accidental killing among believers. It clarifies that a believer should not intentionally kill another believer. However, if a believer unintentionally causes the death of another believer, there are certain expiations and compensations to be fulfilled. The person responsible must free a believing slave and pay compensation to the family of the deceased, unless they willingly choose to forgive or accept the compensation as charity. Different circumstances are considered, such as whether the deceased was from a warring party or a people with whom there is a treaty. If one cannot find a slave to free or afford the compensation, they are required to fast for two consecutive months as an act of repentance. Allah, being All-Knowing and Wise, has provided this guidance to rectify unintentional harm caused between believers.

Verse 93: "And whoever kills a believer intentionally, his recompense is Hell, wherein he will abide eternally, and Allah has become angry with him and has cursed him and has prepared for him a great punishment."

Verse 94: "O you who have believed, when you go forth [to fight] in the cause of Allah, investigate; and do not say to one who gives you [a greeting of] peace, 'You are not a believer,' aspiring for the goods of worldly life; for with Allah are many acquisitions. You [yourselves] were like that before; then Allah conferred His favor upon you, so investigate. Indeed Allah is ever, with what you do, Acquainted."

This verse provides guidance to the believers when they are preparing to go for battle in the cause of Allah. It advises them to verify the sincerity and intentions of those who approach them with peaceful greetings. They should not hastily declare someone as a non-believer out of worldly desires or greed for material gains. Allah has abundant provisions and rewards, so the believers should not be quick to judge. They are reminded that they were also in a similar state before Allah bestowed His favor upon them, so they should conduct thorough investigations and be aware that Allah is fully aware of their actions.

Verse 95: "Not equal are those believers remaining [at home] - other than the disabled - and the mujahideen, [who strive and fight] in the cause of Allah with their wealth and their lives. Allah has preferred the mujahideen through their wealth and their lives over those who remain [behind], by degrees. And to both Allah has promised the best [reward]. But Allah has preferred the mujahideen over those who remain [behind] with a great reward -"

This verse highlights the distinction between believers who stay at home during times of conflict (except for those who are disabled) and those who actively engage in jihad (striving and fighting) for the cause of Allah, sacrificing their wealth and lives. Allah has given the mujahideen a higher rank and reward over those who remain behind. Both groups are promised the best reward from Allah, but the mujahideen are preferred and will receive a great reward.

Verse 96: "Degrees [of high position] from Him and forgiveness and mercy. And Allah is ever Forgiving and Merciful."

This verse emphasizes that Allah grants different ranks and levels of honor to individuals according to their deeds. He bestows forgiveness and mercy upon them, demonstrating His attribute of forgiveness and mercy.

Verse 97: "Indeed, those whom the angels take [in death] while wronging themselves - [the angels] will say, 'In what [condition] were you?' They will say, 'We were oppressed in the land.' The angels will say, 'Was not the earth of Allah spacious [enough] for you to emigrate therein?' For those, their refuge is Hell - and evil it is as a destination."

This verse addresses the situation of those who die while being oppressed or living in unfavorable conditions. When the angels take their souls, they will be questioned about their circumstances and why they did not seek refuge elsewhere. If they respond by saying they were oppressed in their land, the angels will point out that the earth of Allah is vast, and they could have migrated to a safer place. The consequence for their failure to seek refuge or emigrate is that their final abode will be Hell, which is a terrible destination.

Verse 98: "Except for the oppressed among men, women, and children who cannot devise a plan nor are they directed to a way -"

Those who disbelieve wish that you would neglect your weapons and your baggage so they could come down upon you in one [single] attack. But there is no blame upon you, if you are troubled by rain or are ill, for putting down your arms, but take precaution. Indeed, Allah has prepared for the disbelievers a humiliating punishment."

This verse provides guidelines for leading prayer while in a potentially hostile environment. It advises the believers, when leading the congregation in prayer, to have a group of them stand and carry their weapons to remain vigilant and prepared for any potential attack. After the prostration, this group should move behind, while another group that has not yet prayed comes forward to join the prayer, also carrying their arms. This arrangement ensures the defense and security of the community.
