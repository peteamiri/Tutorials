### **Chapter 7: Salesforce Security and Compliance**  
**Title**: *Safeguarding Data and Meeting Regulatory Requirements*  

---

#### **7.1 Security Architecture and Shared Responsibility Model**  
**Objective**: Understand Salesforce’s security framework and customer obligations.  

- **Shared Responsibility Model**:  
  - **Salesforce Responsibilities**: Infrastructure security, physical data centers, platform availability.  
  - **Customer Responsibilities**: Data protection, user access controls, compliance configurations.  
- **Trust Boundaries**:  
  - Secure data flow between Salesforce, third-party apps, and external systems.  
  - **Example**: API endpoints must enforce TLS 1.2+ encryption.  

---

#### **7.2 Data Protection Mechanisms**  
**Objective**: Implement encryption and access controls to secure sensitive data.  

**7.2.1 Encryption**  
- **Encryption in Transit**:  
  - Enforce HTTPS/TLS for all integrations (e.g., REST APIs, Salesforce Communities).  
  - **Salesforce Managed Certificates**: Automatically renewed SSL certificates for custom domains.  
- **Encryption at Rest**:  
  - **Platform Encryption (Shield)**: Encrypt sensitive fields (e.g., SSN, credit card numbers).  
    - **Key Management**: Use Salesforce-managed keys or bring your own (BYOK) via AWS KMS.  
  - **File Encryption**: Encrypt files stored in Salesforce Files or Content Delivery Network (CDN).  

**7.2.2 Field-Level Security (FLS) and Object Permissions**  
- **FLS**: Restrict access to sensitive fields (e.g., `Salary__c`) via profiles/permission sets.  
- **Object Permissions**: Control CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) access at the object level.  

**7.2.3 Network Security**  
- **IP Restrictions**: Whitelist trusted IP ranges for login and API access.  
- **CSP Trusted Sites**: Define allowed domains for embedding content (e.g., scripts, iframes).  

---

#### **7.3 Identity and Access Management (IAM)**  
**Objective**: Ensure only authorized users access sensitive resources.  

**7.3.1 Authentication**  
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**:  
  - Enforce via Salesforce Authenticator, TOTP apps, or hardware tokens.  
  - **Critical Updates**: MFA required for API access (2024 Salesforce mandate).  
- **Single Sign-On (SSO)**:  
  - **SAML 2.0**: Integrate with IdPs like Okta or Azure AD.  
  - **OAuth 2.0**: Secure API access for mobile apps (e.g., JWT bearer flow).  

**7.3.2 Authorization**  
- **Role Hierarchies**: Grant data visibility based on user roles (e.g., managers view subordinate records).  
- **Permission Sets**: Assign granular permissions (e.g., "View All Data" for auditors).  
- **Sharing Rules**: Extend record access beyond org-wide defaults (e.g., share Cases with regional teams).  

---

#### **7.4 Compliance Frameworks**  
**Objective**: Align Salesforce configurations with regulatory standards.  

**7.4.1 General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**  
- **Data Subject Rights**:  
  - **Right to Erasure**: Use **Data Deletion** tools to anonymize/delete personal data.  
  - **Data Portability**: Export user data via **Data Export Service** or APIs.  
- **Data Processing Agreements (DPA)**: Review and accept Salesforce’s GDPR-compliant DPAs.  

**7.4.2 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)**  
- **Shield Platform Encryption**: Encrypt Protected Health Information (PHI) fields.  
- **Audit Trails**: Enable **Field History Tracking** for PHI modifications.  

**7.4.3 Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS)**  
- **Tokenization**: Use third-party payment gateways (e.g., Stripe) to avoid storing card data.  
- **Masking**: Display only the last four digits of credit card numbers.  

**7.4.4 Other Standards**:  
- **SOC 2**: Leverage Salesforce’s SOC 2 reports for vendor audits.  
- **ISO 27001**: Review compliance documentation in the **Trust Portal**.  

---

#### **7.5 Monitoring, Auditing, and Incident Response**  
**Objective**: Proactively detect and respond to security threats.  

**7.5.1 Event Monitoring**  
- **Transaction Security Policies**:  
  - Block suspicious activities (e.g., bulk data exports from unrecognized IPs).  
- **Event Log Files**:  
  - Analyze login attempts, report exports, and API calls via **Salesforce CLI** or third-party SIEM tools.  

**7.5.2 Setup Audit Trail**  
- Track changes to security settings (e.g., profile edits, permission set assignments).  
- **Retention**: Audit logs retained for 180 days (extendable via **Event Monitoring** add-on).  

**7.5.3 Incident Response**  
- **Playbooks**: Define steps for breaches (e.g., revoke compromised user sessions, audit logs).  
- **Salesforce Support**: Report security incidents via **Help & Training Portal**.  

---

#### **7.6 Advanced Security Tools**  
**Objective**: Leverage Salesforce Shield and third-party solutions.  

**7.6.1 Salesforce Shield Suite**  
- **Platform Encryption**: Encrypt up to 100 fields per object (supports deterministic/searchable encryption).  
- **Event Monitoring**: Capture granular user activity (e.g., SOQL queries, report previews).  
- **Field Audit Trail**: Retain 10 years of field history for compliance audits.  

**7.6.2 Third-Party Integrations**  
- **Vault Solutions**: Integrate with CyberArk or HashiCorp Vault for credential management.  
- **SIEM Tools**: Splunk, Datadog, or Sumo Logic for centralized log analysis.

### **Real-World Case Study**  
**Healthcare Provider**:  
- **Challenge**: Securing PHI in Salesforce while meeting HIPAA requirements.  
- **Solution**:  
  1. Enabled **Platform Encryption** for `Patient__c` and `Medical_History__c` objects.  
  2. Enforced **MFA** for all users and restricted API access to VPN IPs.  
  3. Configured **Field Audit Trail** to track PHI access/modifications.  

---

### **Key Takeaways**  
1. **Data Protection**: Combine encryption, FLS, and network controls for defense-in-depth.  
2. **Compliance**: Automate GDPR/HIPAA workflows to minimize manual oversight.  
3. **Monitoring**: Use Event Monitoring to detect anomalies and enforce policies.

### **Review Questions**  
1. How does Shield Platform Encryption differ from classic encryption?  
2. What steps are required to achieve PCI-DSS compliance in Salesforce?  
3. How can Event Monitoring mitigate insider threats?
