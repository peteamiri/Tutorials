# üìö **Glossary of Cloud Computing Terms**

---

## ‚òÅÔ∏è **Core Cloud Concepts**

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Cloud Computing** | Delivery of computing services (servers, storage, databases, networking, software) over the internet. |
| **Public Cloud** | Cloud infrastructure offered by third-party providers over the public internet and shared across users. |
| **Private Cloud** | Cloud infrastructure dedicated to a single organization, either on-premise or hosted externally. |
| **Hybrid Cloud** | Combines public and private clouds, allowing data and apps to move between them. |
| **Multi-cloud** | Use of services from multiple cloud providers for redundancy, cost efficiency, or features. |
| **Scalability** | Ability of a system to handle increased load by scaling up (vertical) or scaling out (horizontal). |
| **Elasticity** | Automatic scaling of resources based on workload demands. |
| **On-Demand Self-Service** | Users can provision resources as needed without human intervention from the provider. |

## üñ•Ô∏è **Cloud Service Models**

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)** | Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet (e.g., VMs, storage). |
| **PaaS (Platform as a Service)** | Provides a development platform with tools for building and deploying applications. |
| **SaaS (Software as a Service)** | Delivers software applications over the internet on a subscription basis. |
| **FaaS (Function as a Service)** | Serverless computing model where functions are triggered by events, not servers. |
| **Serverless Computing** | Execution model where the cloud provider manages server provisioning and scaling. |

## üß± **Cloud Architecture & Infrastructure**

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Virtual Machine (VM)** | Emulated computer system running on a hypervisor that shares physical hardware. |
| **Hypervisor** | Software layer that enables multiple VMs to run on a single physical host. |
| **Container** | Lightweight, portable unit for running applications in isolated environments. |
| **Kubernetes** | Open-source platform for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. |
| **Load Balancer** | Distributes network or application traffic across multiple servers for reliability. |
| **Auto Scaling** | Mechanism to automatically adjust compute resources based on demand. |

## üß© **Storage and Networking**

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Object Storage** | Data storage architecture that manages data as objects (e.g., Amazon S3). |
| **Block Storage** | Data storage method where data is stored in fixed-sized blocks (e.g., Amazon EBS). |
| **File Storage** | Hierarchical storage with folders and files (e.g., Amazon EFS). |
| **Content Delivery Network (CDN)** | Distributed network of servers that deliver content based on geographic location. |
| **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)** | Isolated network environment within a public cloud provider‚Äôs infrastructure. |

## üîê **Security and Compliance**

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **IAM (Identity and Access Management)** | Framework for managing digital identities and access rights. |
| **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** | Adds additional verification steps beyond username and password. |
| **Encryption (At Rest / In Transit)** | Protects data either while stored (at rest) or while transmitted (in transit). |
| **Shared Responsibility Model** | Security model where the cloud provider and customer share security responsibilities. |
| **DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service)** | Malicious attack that floods a network or server to make it unavailable. |
| **Compliance** | Adherence to standards or regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2, PCI-DSS. |

---

## üß™ **Development & Operations (DevOps)**

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery)** | Automated processes for integrating and delivering code changes. |
| **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** | Managing infrastructure using machine-readable configuration files. |
| **Terraform** | IaC tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure. |
| **CloudFormation** | AWS-native IaC tool to model and provision resources. |
| **Observability** | Ability to understand the internal state of a system based on outputs like logs, metrics, and traces. |
| **Monitoring** | Tracking the performance and availability of cloud services and infrastructure. |

## üìä **Data & Analytics**

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Big Data** | Extremely large datasets that require specialized systems for processing. |
| **Data Lake** | Centralized repository that allows storage of structured and unstructured data at scale. |
| **Data Warehouse** | Central database for reporting and data analysis (e.g., Snowflake, Redshift). |
| **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** | Process of moving and transforming data from one system to another. |
| **Streaming Data** | Real-time data continuously generated by sources like IoT devices and apps. |

---

## üí° **Emerging Technologies**

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Edge Computing** | Processing data closer to its source (e.g., sensors, IoT devices) rather than in centralized cloud. |
| **Fog Computing** | Extension of edge computing with intermediate nodes between edge and cloud. |
| **Quantum Computing** | Uses quantum-mechanical phenomena to perform computation, increasingly offered via cloud. |
