3. **Activity-Based Approach**:
   - AWS CAF defines a set of activities and tasks that organizations should undertake at each stage of their cloud adoption journey. These activities include assessing organizational readiness, defining a cloud adoption strategy, building foundational capabilities, migrating workloads to the cloud, optimizing cloud resources, and driving continuous improvement.
   - Organizations can use the activity-based approach to create a structured roadmap for their cloud adoption efforts, prioritize initiatives, allocate resources effectively, and measure the impact of their activities.

4. **Use-Case-Based Approach**:
   - AWS CAF encourages organizations to identify and prioritize use cases that can benefit from cloud adoption. Use cases may include modernizing applications, improving scalability and elasticity, enhancing security and compliance, reducing costs, or enabling innovation and agility.
