## **Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**

AWS EC2 (Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud) is a web service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that allows users to rent virtual servers, known as instances, in the cloud. EC2 provides scalable computing capacity, allowing users to quickly scale up or down based on their needs.

** Key Features of AWS EC2**:

1. Instances: EC2 allows users to create and manage virtual instances, which are essentially virtual servers running in the cloud. Users can choose from a wide range of instance types based on their requirements, such as CPU, memory, storage, and networking capabilities.

2. Elastic IP Addresses: EC2 provides the option to assign static public IP addresses, known as Elastic IP addresses, to instances. This allows users to maintain a consistent IP address even if the instance is stopped or restarted.

3. Security Groups: EC2 uses security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic to instances. Users can define rules to allow or deny specific types of traffic based on protocols, ports, and IP addresses.

4. Storage Options: EC2 offers various storage options, including Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) for persistent block-level storage, Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) for scalable file storage, and instance store volumes for temporary storage.

5. Auto Scaling: EC2 Auto Scaling enables users to automatically adjust the number of instances based on demand. It helps maintain application availability and optimize costs by scaling up or down based on predefined policies.

6. Load Balancing: EC2 Load Balancers distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances to improve application availability and fault tolerance. Users can choose between the Application Load Balancer (ALB) and the Network Load Balancer (NLB) based on their specific needs.

7. Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Integration: EC2 instances can be launched within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), providing users with control over their virtual network environment. Users can define subnets, configure routing tables, and apply network access control lists (ACLs) to secure their instances.

8. Integration with Other AWS Services: EC2 seamlessly integrates with other AWS services, such as Amazon S3 for object storage, Amazon RDS for managed databases, and AWS Lambda for serverless computing.
