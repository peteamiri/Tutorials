## what is cloud

Cloud computing refers to the delivery of computing resources over the internet on a pay-as-you-go basis. Specifically, it encompasses the use of cloud services and technologies provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) to enable organizations to access, manage, and scale their IT infrastructure and applications more efficiently.

Here are some key aspects of cloud computing in the context of the AWS Cloud Practitioner exam:

1. **Essential Characteristics**: Understand the essential characteristics of cloud computing, as defined by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), including on-demand self-service, broad network access, resource pooling, rapid elasticity, and measured service.

2. **Deployment Models**: Learn about different cloud deployment models, such as public cloud, private cloud, hybrid cloud, and multi-cloud environments. Understand the differences between these models and the use cases for each.

3. **Service Models**: Familiarize yourself with the various service models in cloud computing, including Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). Know the characteristics, benefits, and examples of each service model.

4. **AWS Global Infrastructure**: Gain an understanding of AWS global infrastructure, including Regions, Availability Zones (AZs), Edge Locations, and the AWS Global Network. Know how AWS Regions and AZs are organized and the implications for high availability and fault tolerance.

5. **Key AWS Services**: Learn about key AWS services and offerings across different categories, such as:
   - Compute services (e.g., Amazon EC2, AWS Lambda)
   - Storage services (e.g., Amazon S3, Amazon EBS)
   - Database services (e.g., Amazon RDS, Amazon DynamoDB)
   - Networking services (e.g., Amazon VPC, Amazon Route 53)
   - Security services (e.g., AWS IAM, AWS Key Management Service)

6. **Security and Compliance**: Understand AWS security best practices, including the Shared Responsibility Model, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), encryption options, and compliance frameworks. Know how to secure AWS resources and data, and comply with relevant regulations and standards.

7. **Billing and Pricing**: Learn about AWS billing and pricing models, including pay-as-you-go pricing, pricing factors, and cost management tools (e.g., AWS Cost Explorer, AWS Budgets). Understand how to estimate and optimize costs for AWS services and resources.

8. **Documentation and Support**: Familiarize yourself with AWS documentation resources, such as whitepapers, FAQs, user guides, and best practice guides. Understand the different levels of AWS Support plans and when to use them.
