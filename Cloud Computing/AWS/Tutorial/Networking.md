|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) | Amazon VPC enables users to provision a logically isolated section of the AWS cloud where they can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that they define. It provides features for network segmentation, access control, and connectivity options, allowing users to create secure and scalable network environments. |
| Amazon Route 53          | Amazon Route 53 is a scalable and highly available domain name system (DNS) web service that translates domain names into IP addresses. It provides features for domain registration, DNS routing, and health checking, enabling users to route end users to the best available resources with low-latency and high availability. |
| AWS Direct Connect       | AWS Direct Connect provides dedicated network connections between on-premises data centers and AWS cloud infrastructure. It offers private and dedicated connectivity options with consistent network performance, low latency, and reduced data transfer costs compared to internet-based connections. |
| Amazon CloudFront        | Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) service that accelerates the delivery of static and dynamic web content to end users around the world. It caches content at edge locations closer to end users, reducing latency and improving performance for web applications and APIs. |
| Amazon API Gateway       | Amazon API Gateway is a fully managed service that enables users to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale. It provides features for API management, authorization, throttling, and monitoring, allowing users to build scalable and secure APIs for web and mobile applications. |
| AWS Global Accelerator   | AWS Global Accelerator is a network service that improves the availability and performance of applications by directing traffic to the optimal AWS endpoint based on latency, health, and routing policies. It provides features for global traffic management, fault tolerance, and DDoS protection, ensuring a consistent and reliable user experience. |
| AWS Transit Gateway      | AWS Transit Gateway is a fully managed service that simplifies the connectivity between VPCs, on-premises networks, and AWS services. It acts as a central hub for routing traffic between interconnected networks, providing scalable and efficient network connectivity across multiple accounts and virtual private clouds. |
| Amazon VPC Peering       | Amazon VPC Peering enables users to connect VPCs within the same AWS region using private IP addresses. It allows resources in different VPCs to communicate with each other securely, without traversing the internet or requiring gateways. VPC peering is suitable for scenarios requiring private connectivity between VPCs, such as multi-tier applications or shared services. |
