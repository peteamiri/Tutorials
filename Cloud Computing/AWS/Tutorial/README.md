# AWS Cloud Infrastructure

Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides a vast and comprehensive cloud infrastructure that enables businesses and individuals to access a wide range of computing resources on-demand. Here's an overview of the components and services typically found within the AWS cloud infrastructure:

1. **Regions**: AWS infrastructure is distributed across multiple geographical regions worldwide. Each region consists of multiple availability zones.

2. **Availability Zones (AZs)**: Availability Zones are distinct locations within a region that are engineered to be isolated from failures in other Availability Zones. This allows customers to design and operate applications that can tolerate failures with higher resilience and availability.

3. **Edge Locations**: AWS has a global network of edge locations for content delivery, known as Amazon CloudFront. These edge locations serve cached content to users with low latency and high transfer speeds
