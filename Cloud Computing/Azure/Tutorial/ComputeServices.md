This section proovides a table describing Azure cloud compute services;

| Service Name                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Azure Virtual Machines           | Azure Virtual Machines (VMs) allow you to deploy and manage scalable computing resources in the cloud. You can choose from a variety of virtual machine sizes and operating systems to run your applications, workloads, and services. VMs offer flexibility, control, and isolation for your compute needs.                                                                     |
| Azure App Service                | Azure App Service is a fully managed platform for building, deploying, and scaling web applications, APIs, and mobile backends. It supports multiple programming languages and frameworks, including .NET, Java, Node.js, Python, and PHP, enabling developers to focus on building and delivering applications without worrying about infrastructure management.                |
| Azure Functions                  | Azure Functions is a serverless computing service that allows you to run event-driven code in response to triggers or events. You can write functions in multiple languages and trigger them based on events from various Azure services, third-party services, or custom triggers, enabling you to build scalable and cost-effective solutions without managing infrastructure. |
| Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)   | Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is a managed Kubernetes service that simplifies the deployment, management, and scaling of containerized applications using Kubernetes orchestration capabilities. AKS provides automated upgrades, monitoring, and scaling, allowing you to focus on building and running your applications rather than managing Kubernetes infrastructure.      |
| Azure Batch                      | Azure Batch is a fully managed cloud service for running large-scale parallel and high-performance computing (HPC) workloads. It enables you to provision and manage clusters of virtual machines to execute batch processing, parallel compute, and big data workloads efficiently and cost-effectively in the cloud.                                                           |
| Azure Container Instances (ACI)  | Azure Container Instances (ACI) is a serverless container service that allows you to run Docker containers without managing underlying infrastructure. ACI provides fast startup times, auto-scaling, and per-second billing, making it ideal for running short-lived, bursty, or event-driven workloads in the cloud.                                                           |
| Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets | Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets enable you to create and manage a group of identical, load-balanced virtual machines that automatically scale based on demand or a defined schedule. Scale Sets provide high availability, fault tolerance, and autoscaling capabilities, allowing you to handle variable workloads and ensure optimal performance for your applications.       |
| Azure Batch AI                   | Azure Batch AI is a specialized service built on top of Azure Batch that provides infrastructure and tools for training and deploying machine learning models at scale. It enables you to run distributed training jobs, parallel experiments, and hyperparameter tuning on GPU-enabled virtual machines, making it easier to build and deploy AI solutions in the cloud.        |
|                                  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
