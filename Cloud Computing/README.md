# Cloud Computing

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services, including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence , over the internet on a pay-as-you-go basis. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, companies can access technology services, such as computing power, storage, and databases, from a cloud provider, such as Amazon, Microsoft Azure, IBM, Google Cloud, and Oracle. This allows them to scale their computing resources up or down quickly to meet changing business needs and save on infrastructure costs.

Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computing resources, including data storage (cloud storage) and computing power, without direct active management by the user. Large clouds often have functions distributed over multiple locations, each of which is a data center. Cloud computing relies on sharing of resources to achieve coherence and typically uses a pay-as-you-go model, which can help in reducing capital expenses but may also lead to unexpected operating expenses for users.

Cloud computing refers to the delivery of computing resources, such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and analytics, over the internet, also known as "the cloud." Instead of owning and maintaining physical servers and other infrastructure, businesses and individuals can rent access to these resources from cloud service providers, paying only for what they use.

It is important to note that the advantages and disadvantages may vary depending on the specific business needs and use case.
## Types of Services Provided by Cloud Service Providers (CSP)

Cloud service providers offer the following types of cloud computing services as defined by the NIST:

1. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) - provides access to raw computing resources such as storage , servers, and networking.
1. Platform as a Service (PaaS) - provides developers with a platform to develop, run, and manage their applications without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure.
1. Software as a Service (SaaS) - provides access to software applications over the internet on a subscription basis.

Additional Services:

1. Function as a Service (FaaS) - provides a platform for developers to deploy code, which is executed in response to a specific event or trigger.

These cloud computing services can be used individually or in combination to build, deploy, and manage various applications and services.

## Implementation Types

Based on the provided search results, there are different types of cloud implementation, including:

1. Private Cloud - A cloud infrastructure dedicated to a single enterprise. This type of cloud deployment offers greater control and customization but may require more resources and maintenance.

1. Public Cloud - A cloud infrastructure owned and operated by a third-party provider and accessible to the public. This type of cloud deployment offers scalability, cost-efficiency, and accessibility.

1. Hybrid Cloud - A cloud deployment model that combines elements of both private and public clouds, allowing businesses to leverage the benefits of both types of cloud infrastructures while addressing their limitations.

1. Community Cloud - A cloud infrastructure shared by a group of organizations with similar interests and requirements, such as government agencies, research institutions, or healthcare providers. This type of cloud deployment offers collaboration, resource sharing, and cost sharing among community members.

1. multi-cloud.

## Cloud Security standards

Based on the provided search results, some of the cloud security standards include:

* ISO 27001 - Information Security Management System (ISMS) for cloud infrastructure and operations.
* PCI DSS - Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard for cloud service providers handling payment card data.
* HIPAA - Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act for protecting sensitive health information in cloud environments.
* GDPR - General Data Protection Regulation for safeguarding the personal data of European Union citizens in cloud environments.
* CSA STAR - Cloud Security Alliance Security, Trust and Assurance Registry for assessing the security posture of cloud service providers.
* ISO 27018 - Code of practice for protecting personal data in public cloud environments.
* NIST SP 800-53 - Security controls for federal information systems and organizations.
* FedRAMP - Federal Risk Authorization and Management Program for cloud service providers serving the US federal government.

Adhering to these standards and frameworks can help organizations ensure the security and privacy of their data and applications in the cloud.

## Cloud Security Strategy

Cloud security strategy is a comprehensive plan for protecting sensitive data, applications, and infrastructure in cloud environments. It encompasses a range of technologies, policies, controls, and best practices to identify, prevent, detect, and respond to security threats and incidents in the cloud. A cloud security strategy typically involves defining security requirements, assessing risks, implementing security controls, monitoring and analyzing security events, and continuously improving security posture in cloud environments. A well-designed cloud security strategy can help organizations avoid potential security breaches, data loss, and compliance violations, and maintain trust with their customers and partners.

## Cloud Adoptin Framework (CAF)

The Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF) is a collection of documentation , implementation guidance, best practices, and tools that provide proven techncal guidance to organizations for adopting a cloud infrastructure. The framework provides technical guidance for cloud services , and divides the cloud adoption process into different pillars , which typically include business, people, governance, platform, security, and operations , among others. Different cloud service providers, such as AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud, have their own versions of the Cloud Adoption Framework.
