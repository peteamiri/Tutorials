# Cloud Computing

Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computing resources, including data storage (cloud storage) and computing power, without direct active management by the user. Large clouds often have functions distributed over multiple locations, each of which is a data center. Cloud computing relies on sharing of resources to achieve coherence and typically uses a pay-as-you-go model, which can help in reducing capital expenses but may also lead to unexpected operating expenses for users.

Cloud computing refers to the delivery of computing resources, such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and analytics, over the internet, also known as "the cloud." Instead of owning and maintaining physical servers and other infrastructure, businesses and individuals can rent access to these resources from cloud service providers, paying only for what they use.

Cloud computing has several advantages, including flexibility, scalability, cost savings, and the ability to access resources from anywhere with an internet connection. Cloud computing also enables collaboration and sharing of resources among multiple users or teams.

There are several types of cloud computing models, including
* public cloud,
* private cloud,
* hybrid cloud,
* multi-cloud.

Public cloud services are offered by third-party providers, while private clouds are dedicated to a single organization. Hybrid and multi-cloud models combine the benefits of both public and private clouds.
