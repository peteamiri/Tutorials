**Chapter 7: Introduction to DataWeave 2.x**

**Overall Goal:** This chapter introduces DataWeave, MuleSoft's powerful, purpose-built expression and transformation language. After learning how to route events and interact with systems, the reader will now learn the fundamental skill of manipulating the *data* within the Mule Event. This chapter focuses on the core syntax, concepts, and basic operations needed to perform common data transformations between different formats and structures. It aims to build a solid foundation before tackling more complex scenarios in the subsequent chapter.

**Detailed Section Breakdown:**

*   **7.1 Why DataWeave? The Need for Transformation**
    *   **Purpose:** To establish the context and critical importance of data transformation in nearly every integration scenario and position DataWeave as the solution within the MuleSoft ecosystem.
    *   **Content:**
        *   **The Polyglot Enterprise:** Reiterate that different systems (databases, APIs, SaaS platforms, legacy systems) invariably represent data in different formats (JSON, XML, CSV, COBOL Copybooks, Java Objects, etc.) and structures (different field names, nesting levels, data types).
        *   **Connector Output vs. Processor Input:** Explain that a connector might retrieve data in one format (e.g., XML from a SOAP service), but the next component in the flow (e.g., a REST API call expecting JSON, or a Database insert expecting specific fields) requires it in a different format or structure.
        *   **Common Transformation Needs:** Provide concrete examples:
            *   Mapping field names (`order_id` to `PurchaseOrderNumber`).
            *   Changing data types (String to Integer).
            *   Restructuring data (flattening nested objects, creating nested structures from flat ones).
            *   Filtering data (removing unwanted records or fields).
            *   Enriching data (combining data from payload and variables).
            *   Changing formats (XML to JSON, JSON to CSV, etc.).
        *   **Why a Dedicated Language?** Briefly contrast DataWeave with attempting complex transformations using general-purpose languages like Java within Mule (more verbose, less performant for the task, harder to read/maintain for transformation logic). Highlight DataWeave's design goals: functional nature, strong typing (inferred), immutability, focus on data mapping, and integration with Mule runtime.
    *   **Key Takeaway for Reader:** Data transformation is unavoidable in integration. DataWeave is MuleSoft's specialized, powerful, and preferred language designed specifically to handle these transformations efficiently and declaratively.

*   **7.2 DataWeave Basics: Syntax and Structure**
    *   **Purpose:** To introduce the fundamental anatomy of a DataWeave script. How does it look? What are the mandatory parts?
    *   **Content:**
        *   **The "Transform Message" Component:** Explain that DataWeave scripts are most commonly written within the "Transform Message" component in Anypoint Studio, but can also be used inline in many component attributes that accept expressions (`#[...]`).
        *   **Core Structure:** Present a minimal DataWeave script and break it down:
            *   **7.2.1 Header:**
                *   `%dw 2.0`: The mandatory version directive. Emphasize using `2.0` for Mule 4.
                *   `output <MIME_type> [with <writer_properties>]`: Specifies the desired output format (e.g., `output application/json`, `output application/xml`, `output text/csv`). Briefly mention common writer properties (e.g., `indent=false` for JSON, `header=true` for CSV).
                *   (Mention `input` directive exists but is often inferred from the event).
            *   **Separator (`---`):** The mandatory three hyphens separating the header section from the body section.
            *   **7.2.2 Body:**
                *   This is where the transformation logic resides.
                *   The expression in the body defines the structure and content of the *output*.
                *   Start with the simplest example: `payload` (which means the output will be the current Mule Event payload, potentially converted to the format specified in the `output` directive).
        *   **Comments:** Show how to add single-line (`//`) and multi-line (`/* ... */`) comments.
    *   **Key Takeaway for Reader:** Every DataWeave script has a header (defining version and output format) and a body (defining the transformation), separated by `---`.

*   **7.3 Working with Data Formats (JSON, XML, CSV, Java, Flat File)**
    *   **Purpose:** To demonstrate DataWeave's native understanding of common data formats and how easily it handles reading and writing them.
    *   **Content:**
        *   **Built-in Format Support:** Explain that DataWeave has built-in parsers (readers) and writers for major formats.
        *   **Implicit Input Reading:** Explain that DataWeave usually infers the input format from the Mule Event's MIME type (e.g., if an HTTP Listener received `application/json`, `payload` will be treated as JSON).
        *   **Explicit Output Writing:** The `output` directive controls how the result of the body expression is rendered.
        *   **Simple Format Conversion Examples:** Show basic scripts demonstrating format conversions:
            *   JSON Input -> XML Output (`output application/xml --- payload`)
            *   XML Input -> JSON Output (`output application/json --- payload`)
            *   CSV Input -> JSON Output (Show how `payload` becomes an array of objects if headers exist). Mention reader properties (`header=true`, `separator=','`).
            *   Java Object (e.g., List<Map>) -> JSON Output (`output application/json --- payload`)
        *   **Flat File (Brief Mention):** Note that fixed-width or complex delimited files often require a schema definition (FFD) referenced in the reader/writer properties, hinting at more advanced capabilities.
    *   **Key Takeaway for Reader:** DataWeave seamlessly handles reading and writing common data formats like JSON, XML, CSV, and Java objects, making format conversion straightforward using the `output` directive.

*   **7.4 Core Operators and Selectors**
    *   **Purpose:** To teach the fundamental syntax for accessing specific pieces of data within the input structures (primarily `payload`, but also `vars` and `attributes`).
    *   **Content:** Provide clear examples for each selector, assuming common input structures (JSON object, XML element, Array):
        *   **Dot Selector (`.`):** For accessing values in Objects (Maps) by key. Example: `payload.customer.firstName`.
        *   **Index Selector (`[]`):** For accessing elements in Arrays (Lists) by zero-based index. Example: `payload.orders[0]`. Also used for accessing object properties with dynamic keys or keys containing special characters: `payload["order-id"]`.
        *   **Attribute Selector (`.@`):** Specifically for accessing attributes of an XML element. Example: `payload.order.@orderId`. Explain it returns the attribute value.
        *   **Namespace Selector (`.#`):** For accessing XML elements or attributes qualified by a namespace. Example: `payload.ns1#element.@ns2#attribute`. Briefly explain the need to define namespaces in the header (`ns ns1 http://example.com/ns1`) or using wildcard namespaces. Keep it introductory.
        *   **Combining Selectors:** Show chaining selectors. Example: `payload.customers[1].address.street`.
    *   **Key Takeaway for Reader:** Use selectors (`.`, `[]`, `.@`, `.#`) to navigate through input data structures (objects, arrays, XML) and extract the specific values needed for transformation.

*   **7.5 Basic Transformations: Mapping Fields**
    *   **Purpose:** To demonstrate the most common DataWeave task: creating a new output structure and populating it with data selected from the input.
    *   **Content:**
        *   **Object Constructor (`{}`):** Show how to create a new JSON/Map output object. Define key-value pairs where the key is the desired output field name and the value is a DataWeave expression (often using selectors) to populate it. Example: `{ outputField1: payload.inputFieldA, outputField2: payload.customer.address.zipCode }`.
        *   **Array Constructor (`[]`):** Show how to create a simple output array containing literal values or values selected from the input. Example: `[ payload.itemCode, payload.quantity, "Processed" ]`. (Note: mapping *over* input arrays using `map` is deferred to Chapter 8).
        *   **Literal Values:** Reinforce embedding strings (`"value"`), numbers (`123`), booleans (`true`/`false`), and `null`.
        *   **Direct Mapping:** Show mapping an entire input object/array to the output: `{ customer: payload.customer }`.
    *   **Key Takeaway for Reader:** Build output structures (objects or arrays) by defining their elements and using DataWeave expressions and selectors to map data from the input source(s).

*   **7.6 Conditional Logic (if/else, unless, default)**
    *   **Purpose:** To introduce basic conditional expressions for controlling transformation logic based on input data.
    *   **Content:** Provide clear syntax and examples for use within the body, typically when defining field values:
        *   **`if`/`else`:** `if (boolean_condition) <value_if_true> else <value_if_false>`. Example: `priority: if (payload.orderTotal > 1000) "High" else "Normal"`.
        *   **`unless`/`else`:** `unless (boolean_condition) <value_if_false> else <value_if_true>`. Explain it's syntactic sugar for `if (!condition)`. Example: `needsReview: unless (payload.isValidated) true else false`.
        *   **`default`:** `<expression> default <default_value>`. Provides a fallback value if the main expression evaluates to `null`. Crucial for handling potentially missing fields gracefully. Example: `region: payload.address.region default "N/A"`.
        *   **Nesting:** Briefly show how conditions can be nested if necessary.
    *   **Key Takeaway for Reader:** Use `if/else`, `unless`, and `default` to apply conditional rules when mapping data, making transformations more dynamic and robust against missing data.

*   **7.7 Using Variables and Functions within DataWeave**
    *   **Purpose:** To introduce mechanisms for creating local, reusable logic and temporary storage *within* a DataWeave script, improving readability and maintainability.
    *   **Content:**
        *   **Local Variables (`var`):**
            *   Syntax: `var myVariableName = <expression>`.
            *   Scope: Defined either in the header (globally for the script) or in the body (locally within the current scope, e.g., inside `{}`).
            *   Use Case: Storing the result of a complex calculation or selection once to avoid repeating it. Improves readability. Example: `var customer = payload.customer; { name: customer.name, email: customer.email }`.
        *   **Local Functions (`fun`):**
            *   Syntax: `fun myFunctionName(param1, param2...) = <expression_body>`.
            *   Scope: Typically defined in the header for script-wide use.
            *   Use Case: Encapsulating simple, reusable formatting or calculation logic. Example: `fun fullName(fName, lName) = fName ++ " " ++ lName; { customerName: fullName(payload.firstName, payload.lastName) }`. Keep function examples simple here.
    *   **Key Takeaway for Reader:** Use `var` to define temporary variables and `fun` to define simple reusable functions within your DataWeave script to make complex transformations cleaner and easier to understand.

*   **7.8 Previewing and Debugging DataWeave Scripts**
    *   **Purpose:** To equip the reader with the essential skill of testing and iterating on DataWeave transformations directly within Anypoint Studio.
    *   **Content:**
        *   **The Transform Message UI:** Highlight the different panels in the Transform Message component editor.
        *   **Input Panel:** Show how to define sample input data for `payload`, `attributes`, and `vars`. Demonstrate creating sample structures manually or loading from sample files (JSON, XML, etc.). Stress the importance of representative sample data.
        *   **Script Editor:** Where the DataWeave code is written.
        *   **Output Panel / Preview:** Explain that as the script is typed (or after clicking a refresh/preview button), the output panel shows the *result* of the transformation based on the current script and the defined sample input data. This provides immediate feedback.
        *   **Identifying Errors:** Show how syntax errors or runtime errors during preview (e.g., type mismatch, selector not found on `null`) are highlighted in the script editor and/or reported in the output/problems view.
    *   **Key Takeaway for Reader:** Leverage the interactive Preview feature in Anypoint Studio by providing sample input data to rapidly develop, test, and debug DataWeave scripts without needing to run the entire Mule application.

*   **7.9 Chapter Summary**
    *   **Purpose:** To consolidate the foundational DataWeave concepts and skills learned in the chapter.
    *   **Content:** Briefly recap: the critical role of transformation, the basic structure of a DataWeave script (`%dw 2.0`, `output`, `---`, body), native handling of common data formats, using core selectors (`.`, `[]`, `.@`), basic object/array construction for mapping, applying conditional logic (`if`/`default`), using local variables/functions (`var`/`fun`), and the importance of the Preview tool for development.
    *   **Transition:** State that the reader now has the fundamental building blocks for DataWeave. Chapter 8 will significantly expand on this foundation, introducing powerful functions for working with arrays and objects, more advanced operators, techniques for modularity, error handling within DataWeave, and other essential features for tackling real-world transformation complexity.
