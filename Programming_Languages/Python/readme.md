1. Fluency in the Python Programming Language
The very first, and most important, Python skill a dev should know is the Python programming language itself. You simply won’t be able to find work as a Python developer if you don’t know any Python.

2. Knowledge of Python Frameworks and Libraries
It makes sense that Python devs should know and be fluent in Python. It also makes sense that they should know of the language’s frameworks and libraries. Knowing at least the biggest and most popular of both can help you work more efficiently and consistently.

Not to mention, many employers and Python projects use specific frameworks and libraries and will only hire devs who are familiar with those.

3. Core Python Expertise
Any Python developer should have Core Python expertise. That means knowledge of concepts including but not limited to:

Generators
Iterators
File handling concepts
Exception handling
OOPs concepts
Data types and variables
Data structures
4. HTML, CSS, JavaScript
You might think that HTML, CSS, and JavaScript aren’t really vital Python developer skills in 2023. And while it’s true that knowing them isn’t a must, it can still be a huge plus.

Python devs frequently work with front-end tools and technologies. Thus, knowing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can help them see and understand the bigger picture of how platforms, websites, or web apps should look and work.

5. Understanding Object Relational Mappers
ORMs or Object Relational Mappers facilitate data transfer from relational databases to Python objects. They are a class of libraries that convert data from an incompatible type to a type that can be used in Python. ORMs are great to learn because they can save devs a lot of time.

6. Good Debugging Skills
Python developers aren’t just responsible for writing and maintaining code. They should also have some good debugging skills that can help them diagnose and fix issues in their projects. It’s also a good idea to learn some unit testing skills.

7. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
The vast majority of data scientists and engineers use Python at some point. And if you’d like to work in data science, it’s good to add some AI and machine learning skills to your repertoire. AI/ML skills can also come in handy outside of data science, as many organizations and businesses have begun including both in their strategies.

8. Knowledge of Version Control and Related Tools
Any developer should understand and be able to use version control tools. Version control can help keep projects organized and track every single change. Practically every potential employer expects developers to know how to manage version control.

9. Understanding Multi-Process Architecture
One of the Python skills in demand today is being able to understand and work with multi-process architecture. Although design engineers are often responsible for knowing the codes used in release and deployment, developers must also have at least a basic understanding.

If you want to succeed as a Python developer, it’d be good to know about the Model View Template (MVT) and Model View Controller (MVC) architectures.

10. Soft Skills
Like any other developer, Python devs should have some soft skills that make it possible to work well with others. That means having good communication skills and being able to collaborate with other developers and team members. Other great soft skills to have include patience and attention to detail.
