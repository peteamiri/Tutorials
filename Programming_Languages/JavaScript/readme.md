## Sample code

```javascript
// Declare variables
var name = "John";
var age = 25;
var isStudent = true;

// Print variables to the console
console.log("Name:", name);
console.log("Age:", age);
console.log("Is Student:", isStudent);

// Perform arithmetic operations
var a = 10;
var b = 5;
var sum = a + b;
var difference = a - b;
var product = a * b;
var quotient = a / b;

// Print arithmetic results to the console
console.log("Sum:", sum);
console.log("Difference:", difference);
console.log("Product:", product);
console.log("Quotient:", quotient);

// Conditional statement
if (age >= 18) {
  console.log("You are an adult.");
} else {
  console.log("You are a minor.");
}

// Looping statement
for (var i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
  console.log("Iteration:", i);
}

```

In this code snippet, we declare variables (name, age, and isStudent) and assign them values. We then use console.log() to print the variables' values to the console.

Next, we perform some basic arithmetic operations (sum, difference, product, and quotient) and print the results to the console.

We include a conditional statement (if-else) to check if the age variable is greater than or equal to 18 and print the appropriate message.

Lastly, we use a for loop to iterate from 1 to 5 and print the iteration number to the console.

You can run this JavaScript code in any JavaScript runtime environment, such as a web browser console or a Node.js environment.
