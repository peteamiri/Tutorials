# First Class

The following is the first Java Class

	1  public class MyFirstClass {
  2  	public static void main(String[] args) {
  3  		System.out.println("Hello World");
  4   }
  5  }

The above is a class definition for MyFirstClass
* Line 1 : defines the class name
* Line 2 : defined the method in the class
* Line 3 : prints "Hello World" sting int the console
* Line 4 : indicates the end of the main method
* Line 5 : indicates the end of the class definition

This must be save in that file with the same name as the classname with java extenstion (MyFirstClass.java).


Absolutely! Here's a **comprehensive and detailed table of contents** for a technical book on **Core Java**, aimed at learners who want to master Java fundamentals, core APIs, and key object-oriented programming concepts. This structure is great for both beginners and intermediate Java developers, with real-world applications and best practices.
