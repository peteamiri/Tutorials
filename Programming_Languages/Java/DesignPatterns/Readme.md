# Java Design Patterns

## Resources

* [GitHub Resource](https://github.com/iluwatar/java-design-patterns)

Absolutely! Here's a **detailed and logically structured table of contents** for a **technical book on Java Design Patterns**. This outline covers all the **Gang of Four (GoF)** design patterns and goes further to include **modern patterns**, **best practices**, and **real-world Java applications**, making it suitable for intermediate to advanced Java developers.

Would you like this as a structured **course curriculum**, or maybe broken into **chapter-length summaries with example projects**? I can also tailor this for a specific audience (e.g., junior devs, architects, or job interview prep).
