## JDK vs. JVM in Java

When discussing Java programming, it's important to understand the distinctions between the Java Development Kit (JDK) and the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

**JDK (Java Development Kit)**
- The JDK is a software development kit used to create applications in Java. It contains a range of development tools, including compilers, JavaDoc, and Java Debugger, in addition to the Java Runtime Environment (JRE).
- It is platform-specific and provides all the tools, executables, and binaries required to compile, debug, and execute a Java program.
- JDK is considered the superset of JRE, as it includes JRE along with the Java compiler, debugger, and core classes.

**JVM (Java Virtual Machine)**
- JVM is an abstract machine that provides a runtime environment in which Java bytecode can be executed. It is responsible for executing Java programs line by line, making it known as an interpreter.
- JVM is contained or inbuilt in both JDK and JRE. When a Java program is run using JRE or JDK, it goes into the JVM for execution.
- It is platform-dependent and has three notions: specification, implementation, and instance. The JVM verifies, loads, and executes the Java bytecode.

In summary, the JDK is used for developing Java applications and contains tools for compiling, debugging, and executing Java programs, while the JVM provides the runtime environment for executing Java bytecode. Understanding the roles of JDK and JVM is crucial for Java developers to effectively create and run Java applications.

## Common Java Editors (IDE)

## First Java Program

To write your first Java class, you can follow these general steps:

### Step 1: Set Up Your Environment
- Ensure that you have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system. If not, download and install the JDK from the official Oracle website.

### Step 2: Create a Java Source File
1. Open a text editor such as Notepad or a dedicated code editor.
2. Type the following code to create a simple Java class:
   ```java
   public class MyFirstProgram {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           System.out.println("Hello, World");
       }
   }
   ```
   In this example, "MyFirstProgram" is the name of the class, and the `main` method is the entry point of the program.

### Step 3: Save the File
- Save the file with a `.java` extension, using the class name as the file name. For example, save the file as `MyFirstProgram.java`.

### Step 4: Compile the Java Source File
- Open a terminal or command prompt.
- Navigate to the directory where the Java source file is saved.
- Compile the Java source file using the Java compiler (javac) by running the command:
  ```
  javac MyFirstProgram.java
  ```
  This will generate a bytecode file named `MyFirstProgram.class`.

### Step 5: Run the Java Program
- In the same terminal or command prompt, run the compiled Java program using the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) by executing the command:
  ```
  java MyFirstProgram
  ```
  This will execute the program and display the output, which in this case is "Hello, World".

By following these steps, you can create and run your first Java class. It's important to ensure that you have the JDK installed and properly configured on your system to compile and run Java programs.

Remember to replace "MyFirstProgram" with your desired class name, and ensure that the file names and class names match exactly, as Java is case-sensitive.

## `System.out.printf()`

In Java, `System.out.printf()` method is used for formatted output. This method allows you to print formatted strings to the standard output stream (usually the console). Here's a detailed description along with examples:

### Syntax:
```java
System.out.printf(String format, Object... args);
```

- `format`: A format string that specifies how the output should be formatted.
- `args`: Arguments to be formatted according to the format string.

### Format Specifiers:
Format specifiers are placeholders in the format string that are replaced by the corresponding arguments.

- `%s`: String
- `%d`: Integer
- `%f`: Floating-point number
- `%c`: Character
- `%b`: Boolean
- `%t`: Date/time
- `%n`: Newline

### Examples:

#### 1. Printing String and Integer:
```java
String name = "John";
int age = 30;
System.out.printf("Name: %s, Age: %d%n", name, age);
```

#### 2. Printing Floating-Point Numbers:
```java
double price = 19.99;
System.out.printf("Price: %.2f%n", price);  // Print with 2 decimal places
```

#### 3. Printing Characters:
```java
char grade = 'A';
System.out.printf("Grade: %c%n", grade);
```

#### 4. Printing Booleans:
```java
boolean flag = true;
System.out.printf("Flag: %b%n", flag);
```

#### 5. Printing Date/Time:
```java
import java.time.LocalDateTime;

LocalDateTime now = LocalDateTime.now();
System.out.printf("Date/Time: %tF %tT%n", now, now);
```

#### 6. Padding and Alignment:
```java
String product = "Phone";
double price = 599.99;
System.out.printf("%-10s | %10.2f%n", product, price);  // Left-aligned and right-aligned
```

#### 7. Argument Indexing:
```java
String name = "Alice";
int age = 25;
System.out.printf("Age: %2$d, Name: %1$s%n", name, age);  // Reorder arguments
```

### Format Flags:
Format flags modify the behavior of format specifiers.

- `-`: Left-justify the output.
- `+`: Include a sign (+ or -) for numeric values.
- `0`: Pad numeric values with leading zeros.
- `,`: Include locale-specific grouping separators.
- `(`: Enclose negative numbers in parentheses.

### Example with Flags:
```java
double number = -1234.5678;
System.out.printf("Number: %(,.2f%n", number);  // Print with parentheses for negative numbers and grouping separator
```

### Summary:
`System.out.printf()` in Java provides a powerful way to format output strings with various data types and styles. By using format specifiers, flags, and argument indexing, you can customize the appearance of your output according to your requirements. This method is commonly used for generating formatted output in console applications, debugging, and logging.

### Formatting variable

In Java, formatting values for variables involves converting data into a specific string representation according to certain rules or patterns. This is often useful when displaying data to users or when writing data to files. Java provides several mechanisms for formatting values, including string concatenation, the `String.format()` method, and the `printf` method from `System.out`. Here's a detailed description with examples of each approach:

### 1. String Concatenation:
String concatenation involves combining strings and variables using the `+` operator.

Example:
```java
int age = 25;
String name = "Alice";
System.out.println("Name: " + name + ", Age: " + age);
```

### 2. Using String.format():
The `String.format()` method allows you to create formatted strings using placeholders and arguments.

Example:
```java
int age = 25;
String name = "Alice";
String formattedString = String.format("Name: %s, Age: %d", name, age);
System.out.println(formattedString);
```

### 3. printf Method:
The `printf` method from `System.out` allows you to format output similar to `String.format()` but directly prints the formatted string.

Example:
```java
int age = 25;
String name = "Alice";
System.out.printf("Name: %s, Age: %d%n", name, age);
```

### Formatting Rules:
- Placeholders in the format string start with `%` followed by a conversion character (such as `s` for string, `d` for integer, `f` for floating-point, etc.).
- The placeholders are replaced by corresponding arguments in the order they appear in the argument list.
- You can specify additional formatting options such as width, precision, alignment, and padding.

Example with Formatting Options:
```java
double price = 19.99;
System.out.printf("Price: %8.2f%n", price);  // Print with 2 decimal places and 8 characters width
```

### Summary:
- String concatenation, `String.format()`, and `System.out.printf()` are commonly used for formatting values in Java.
- String concatenation is simple but less flexible.
- `String.format()` provides more control over formatting and creates a formatted string.
- `System.out.printf()` directly prints formatted output to the console.
- Use placeholders and formatting options to customize the output according to your requirements.


## Using Import statement
In Java, the `import` statement is used to bring classes, interfaces, enums, and packages into scope, allowing you to use their members (fields, methods, nested types) in your code. It helps organize code and avoids redundancy by referencing classes and packages without needing their fully qualified names. Here's a detailed description with lots of examples on how to use the `import` statement in Java:

### 1. Importing Single Class:
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
        // Now you can use ArrayList class without fully qualifying it
    }
}
```

### 2. Importing Multiple Classes from the Same Package:
```java
import java.util.*;

public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
        HashSet<String> set = new HashSet<>();
        // Both ArrayList and HashSet are imported from java.util package
    }
}
```

### 3. Importing All Classes from a Package (Not Recommended):
```java
import java.util.*;

public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Now all classes/interfaces/enums in java.util package are imported
        ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
        HashSet<String> set = new HashSet<>();
        // ...
    }
}
```
**Note**: Importing all classes from a package using `*` is not recommended as it can lead to name conflicts and makes the code less readable.

### 4. Importing Static Members:
```java
import static java.lang.Math.*;

public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double result = sqrt(25); // sqrt is a static method imported from Math class
        System.out.println("Square root of 25 is " + result);
    }
}
```

### 5. Aliasing Imported Classes:
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.HashMap;

public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
        HashMap<Integer, String> map = new HashMap<>();
        // Now you can use list and map without fully qualifying them
    }
}
```

### 6. Using Fully Qualified Names:
```java
public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        java.util.ArrayList<String> list = new java.util.ArrayList<>();
        // Using fully qualified names without importing
    }
}
```

### 7. Importing Classes from Custom Packages:
```java
import com.example.MyClass; // Assuming MyClass is in the com.example package

public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyClass obj = new MyClass();
        // Using MyClass from com.example package
    }
}
```

### 8. Importing Classes from Subpackages:
```java
import com.example.util.*; // Assuming util package is a subpackage of com.example

public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Now all classes/interfaces/enums in com.example.util package are imported
        MyClass obj = new MyClass();
        // ...
    }
}
```

### Summary:
- The `import` statement in Java is used to bring classes, interfaces, enums, and packages into scope.
- It helps avoid fully qualifying class names, making code more readable and concise.
- You can import single classes, multiple classes from the same package, or all classes from a package (not recommended).
- Static members (fields and methods) can be imported using the `import static` statement.
- Aliasing imported classes with different names is possible.
- Fully qualified names can be used without importing, but it's less readable.
- You can import classes from custom packages and their subpackages.

By using the `import` statement effectively, you can organize your Java code more efficiently and improve its maintainability.

## variables

In Java, variables are used to store data that can be manipulated and accessed throughout the program. Variables have a specific data type that determines the kind of data they can hold. Here's a detailed description of variables in Java with lots of examples:

### 1. Variable Declaration and Initialization:
```java
int number; // Declaration
number = 10; // Initialization
```

### 2. Primitive Data Types:
Java supports several primitive data types, including `int`, `double`, `boolean`, `char`, etc.

```java
int age = 25;
double pi = 3.14;
boolean isValid = true;
char grade = 'A';
```

### 3. Reference Data Types:
Java also has reference data types like objects and arrays. These store references to objects in memory.

```java
String name = "John";
Object obj = new Object();
int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
```

### 4. Variable Scope:
Variables have a scope that determines where they can be accessed in the code.

```java
int x = 10; // Global variable

public void method() {
    int y = 20; // Local variable
    System.out.println(x); // Accessing global variable
}
```

### 5. Final Variables:
Variables declared with the `final` keyword cannot be reassigned once initialized.

```java
final int SIZE = 10;
```

### 6. Variable Naming Conventions:
- Variable names must begin with a letter, dollar sign `$`, or underscore `_`.
- Subsequent characters can be letters, digits, dollar signs, or underscores.
- CamelCase is commonly used for variable names (e.g., `myVariable`).

### 7. Variable Initialization:
Variables must be initialized before they can be used.

```java
int a;
System.out.println(a); // Error: Variable 'a' might not have been initialized
```

### 8. Variable Types and Memory Allocation:
Primitive data types are stored directly in memory, while reference data types store memory addresses.

```java
int num1 = 10;
String name = "John";

// Memory:
// num1: 10
// name: [Memory Address]
```

### 9. Variable Shadowing:
Local variables can shadow variables with the same name in the outer scope.

```java
int x = 5;

public void method() {
    int x = 10; // Shadows the global variable x
    System.out.println(x); // Prints 10
}
```

### 10. Variable Casting:
Data type conversion is possible using casting.

```java
double d = 3.14;
int i = (int) d; // Casts double to int (loss of precision)
System.out.println(i); // Prints 3
```

### 11. Variable Initialization Blocks:
Initialization blocks are executed when an object is created.

```java
public class MyClass {
    {
        System.out.println("Initialization block executed");
    }

    public MyClass() {
        System.out.println("Constructor called");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyClass obj = new MyClass();
    }
}
```

### Summary:
- Variables in Java are used to store data and have specific data types.
- Java supports primitive data types (int, double, boolean, etc.) and reference data types (objects, arrays).
- Variables must be declared and initialized before use.
- Variable scope determines where a variable can be accessed.
- Final variables cannot be reassigned.
- Variable naming conventions should be followed for readability.
- Data type conversion is possible using casting.
- Initialization blocks are executed when objects are created.
- Understanding variables is fundamental to Java programming and is crucial for writing efficient and readable code.

## Variable Naming
Variable naming is a crucial aspect of writing clean and maintainable code in Java. Well-named variables improve code readability and comprehension, making it easier for developers to understand the purpose and intent of the code. Here's a detailed description of variable naming conventions in Java with lots of examples:

### 1. CamelCase:
- Use camelCase for variable names.
- Start with a lowercase letter and capitalize the first letter of each subsequent word.
- Do not use underscores.

#### Example:
```java
int myVariable;
String firstName;
double totalPrice;
```

### 2. Meaningful Names:
- Choose variable names that accurately describe the purpose or content of the variable.
- Avoid single-letter names unless used in loop counters.
- Use descriptive names that convey the meaning of the variable.

#### Example:
```java
int numberOfStudents;
String customerName;
double averageTemperature;
```

### 3. Constants:
- Constants should be named using uppercase letters with underscores separating words.
- Use `final` keyword to declare constants.

#### Example:
```java
final int MAX_VALUE = 100;
final double PI = 3.14;
final String COMPANY_NAME = "ABC Corp";
```

### 4. Acronyms and Abbreviations:
- Use full words instead of abbreviations whenever possible.
- If an abbreviation is commonly known, it can be used.
- Capitalize all letters of an abbreviation or acronym.

#### Example:
```java
int numberOfEmployees; // Preferred over 'numEmp'
String htmlContent;
```

### 5. Meaningful Context:
- Provide context when naming variables to avoid ambiguity.
- Use prefixes or suffixes to indicate the variable's role or type.

#### Example:
```java
int studentAge;
String customerAddress;
boolean isValidInput;
```

### 6. Avoid Reserved Words:
- Do not use Java reserved keywords as variable names.

#### Example:
```java
// Incorrect
int int = 10; // 'int' is a reserved keyword

// Correct
int myInt = 10;
```

### 7. Consistency:
- Be consistent with naming conventions throughout the codebase.
- Use the same naming style for variables, methods, classes, and other identifiers.

#### Example:
```java
// Inconsistent
int numberOfStudents;
String FirstName;
double total_price;

// Consistent
int numberOfStudents;
String firstName;
double totalPrice;
```

### 8. Meaningful Variable Names vs. Shorter Names:
- Prioritize clarity and readability over brevity.
- Avoid overly long names, but make sure the name accurately describes the variable's purpose.

#### Example:
```java
// Clear and concise
int numStudents;

// Avoid overly long names
int numberOfStudentsInClassroomAtAnyGivenTime;
```

### Summary:
- Use camelCase for variable names.
- Choose meaningful and descriptive names.
- Use constants for fixed values.
- Avoid abbreviations and single-letter names.
- Provide meaningful context and avoid ambiguity.
- Be consistent with naming conventions.
- Prioritize clarity and readability over brevity.
- Follow these guidelines to improve code readability and maintainability.

## More on Naming Conventions

In Java, naming conventions are important for writing readable and maintainable code. They define a set of rules for naming various program elements such as classes, variables, methods, packages, etc. Adhering to naming conventions makes your code easier to understand and follow. Below are the commonly used naming conventions in Java with lots of examples:

### 1. Class Names:
- Class names should be nouns and written in UpperCamelCase.
- Start with an uppercase letter and capitalize the first letter of each subsequent word.

#### Example:
```java
class MyClass {
    // Class body
}
```

### 2. Interface Names:
- Interface names should also be written in UpperCamelCase.
- Preferably, they should be nouns or adjectives.

#### Example:
```java
interface MyInterface {
    // Interface methods
}
```

### 3. Method Names:
- Method names should be verbs or verb phrases and written in lowerCamelCase.
- Start with a lowercase letter and capitalize the first letter of each subsequent word.

#### Example:
```java
void myMethod() {
    // Method body
}
```

### 4. Variable Names:
- Variable names should be written in lowerCamelCase.
- They should be meaningful and descriptive.

#### Example:
```java
int myVariable = 10;
```

### 5. Constant Names:
- Constant names should be written in uppercase letters with underscores separating words (also known as snake_case).
- Constants should be declared using the `final` keyword.

#### Example:
```java
final int MAX_VALUE = 100;
```

### 6. Package Names:
- Package names should be written in lowercase letters.
- They should be unique and meaningful, usually following the reverse domain name convention.

#### Example:
```java
package com.example.myproject;
```

### 7. Enum Types:
- Enum types should be written in UpperCamelCase.
- Enum constants should be written in uppercase letters.

#### Example:
```java
enum DayOfWeek {
    SUNDAY, MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY
}
```

### 8. Method Arguments:
- Method arguments should be written in lowerCamelCase.
- They should be descriptive and indicate their purpose.

#### Example:
```java
void printMessage(String message) {
    System.out.println(message);
}
```

### Summary:
- Consistency is key when applying naming conventions in Java.
- Use meaningful and descriptive names to improve code readability.
- Adhering to naming conventions makes your code more understandable and maintainable by yourself and others.


## Reserved Words

here's a comprehensive table of all reserved words in Java:

*Note: `const` and `goto` are reserved but not used in the Java language.

These keywords are part of the Java language specification and have special meanings. They cannot be used as identifiers (such as variable names, method names, or class names) in your Java programs. Using reserved words as identifiers will result in compilation errors.

## Variable types

Below is a table describing the variable types in Java, including their names, memory sizes, limits, and descriptions:

| Variable Type | Name          | Memory Size      | Limits                       | Description                                                                                       |
|---------------|---------------|------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `byte`        | Byte          | 1 byte           | -128 to 127                  | Represents an 8-bit signed integer value.                                                        |

- **Memory Size**: The amount of memory required to store each variable type.
- **Limits**: The range of values that each variable type can represent.
- **Description**: A brief description of each variable type.

These variable types are fundamental in Java programming and are used to store different types of data in memory. Understanding their characteristics is essential for writing efficient and effective Java programs.

In Java, variable types determine the kind of data that can be stored in a variable and the operations that can be performed on that data. Java supports several primitive data types and also provides mechanisms for creating user-defined types through classes and interfaces. Below is a detailed description of variable types in Java with lots of examples:

### 1. Primitive Data Types:

#### a. `byte`:
- Represents an 8-bit signed integer value.
- Range: -128 to 127.

Example:
```java
byte age = 30;
```

#### b. `short`:
- Represents a 16-bit signed integer value.
- Range: -32,768 to 32,767.

Example:
```java
short population = 25000;
```

#### c. `int`:
- Represents a 32-bit signed integer value.
- Range: -2^31 to 2^31-1.

Example:
```java
int population = 1000000;
```

#### d. `long`:
- Represents a 64-bit signed integer value.
- Range: -2^63 to 2^63-1.

Example:
```java
long population = 7000000000L; // Note the 'L' suffix to indicate a long literal
```

#### e. `float`:
- Represents a single-precision 32-bit floating-point value.
- Example: ±3.40282347E+38F (6-7 significant decimal digits).

Example:
```java
float temperature = 25.5f; // Note the 'f' suffix to indicate a float literal
```

#### f. `double`:
- Represents a double-precision 64-bit floating-point value.
- Example: ±1.79769313486231570E+308D (15 significant decimal digits).

Example:
```java
double price = 19.99;
```

#### g. `char`:
- Represents a single 16-bit Unicode character.
- Range: 0 to 65,535.

Example:
```java
char grade = 'A';
```

#### h. `boolean`:
- Represents a boolean value (`true` or `false`).
- Size: 1 bit.

Example:
```java
boolean isPassed = true;
```

### 2. User-Defined Types:

#### a. Classes:
Classes are blueprints for creating objects. They encapsulate data for the object and provide methods to operate on that data.

Example:
```java
class Person {
    String name;
    int age;
}
```

#### b. Interfaces:
Interfaces declare a set of methods that a class implementing the interface must provide.

Example:
```java
interface Drawable {
    void draw();
}
```

### Summary:
- Java supports primitive data types (`byte`, `short`, `int`, `long`, `float`, `double`, `char`, `boolean`) and user-defined types (classes, interfaces).
- Primitive data types are used to store simple values, while user-defined types allow for the creation of more complex data structures and behaviors.
- Understanding variable types and their characteristics is essential for writing clear, concise, and maintainable Java code.

## Casting

In Java, casting is the process of converting a value of one data type into another. Casting is mainly used when you want to assign a value of one data type to a variable of another data type, or when you want to force a value to be of a specific data type. There are two types of casting: implicit casting (also known as widening or automatic casting) and explicit casting (also known as narrowing or manual casting). Here's a detailed description of casting in Java with lots of examples:

### 1. Implicit Casting:
Implicit casting occurs when you assign a value of a smaller data type to a variable of a larger data type. Java automatically performs this type of casting because there is no loss of data.

#### Example:
```java
int intValue = 10;
long longValue = intValue; // Implicit casting from int to long
System.out.println(longValue); // Outputs: 10
```

### 2. Explicit Casting:
Explicit casting occurs when you manually convert a value of a larger data type to a smaller data type. This type of casting may result in loss of data if the value cannot be represented by the target data type.

#### Example:
```java
double doubleValue = 10.5;
int intValue = (int) doubleValue; // Explicit casting from double to int
System.out.println(intValue); // Outputs: 10 (fractional part is truncated)
```

### 3. Widening and Narrowing:
- **Widening (Implicit Casting)**: When you assign a value of a smaller data type to a variable of a larger data type.
- **Narrowing (Explicit Casting)**: When you assign a value of a larger data type to a variable of a smaller data type. This requires explicit casting and may result in loss of data.

### 4. Casting between Related Types:
You can cast between related types such as primitive numeric types (byte, short, int, long, float, double) and char.

#### Example:
```java
int intValue = 65;
char charValue = (char) intValue; // Explicit casting from int to char
System.out.println(charValue); // Outputs: A (ASCII value 65 represents character 'A')
```

### 5. Be Mindful of Data Loss:
When narrowing, be mindful of potential loss of data due to truncation or loss of precision.

#### Example:
```java
double doubleValue = 10.999;
int intValue = (int) doubleValue; // Explicit casting from double to int
System.out.println(intValue); // Outputs: 10 (fractional part is truncated)
```

### Summary:
- Casting in Java allows you to convert values from one data type to another.
- Implicit casting occurs automatically when assigning values of smaller data types to larger data types.
- Explicit casting requires manual intervention and may result in loss of data, so it should be used carefully.
- Be mindful of data loss when narrowing, as it can lead to unexpected results.

## swap two variables

Swapping two variables means exchanging their values. In Java, you can accomplish this using various techniques, including using a temporary variable, using arithmetic operations, or using bitwise XOR operation. Here's a detailed explanation of each method with examples:

### 1. Using a Temporary Variable:
This is the most straightforward method. You temporarily store the value of one variable in a temporary variable, then assign the value of the second variable to the first, and finally assign the value of the temporary variable to the second variable.

```java
int a = 5;
int b = 10;

// Swapping using a temporary variable
int temp = a;
a = b;
b = temp;

System.out.println("a = " + a); // Output: a = 10
System.out.println("b = " + b); // Output: b = 5
```

### 2. Using Arithmetic Operations:
This method takes advantage of arithmetic operations to perform the swap without using a temporary variable.

```java
int a = 5;
int b = 10;

// Swapping using arithmetic operations
a = a + b;
b = a - b;
a = a - b;

System.out.println("a = " + a); // Output: a = 10
System.out.println("b = " + b); // Output: b = 5
```

### 3. Using Bitwise XOR Operation:
This method uses bitwise XOR operation to perform the swap without using a temporary variable. It is efficient but may not be as readable as the other methods.

```java
int a = 5;
int b = 10;

// Swapping using bitwise XOR operation
a = a ^ b;
b = a ^ b;
a = a ^ b;

System.out.println("a = " + a); // Output: a = 10
System.out.println("b = " + b); // Output: b = 5
```

### 4. Using Java 8's Stream API (Optional):
With Java 8's Stream API, you can swap two variables using a single line of code, but this approach is not commonly used.

```java
int a = 5;
int b = 10;

// Swapping using Java 8's Stream API
a = b + ((b = a) * 0);

System.out.println("a = " + a); // Output: a = 10
System.out.println("b = " + b); // Output: b = 5
```

### Summary:
- Swapping two variables can be done using a temporary variable, arithmetic operations, bitwise XOR operation, or Java 8's Stream API.
- Using a temporary variable is the most common and straightforward approach.
- Arithmetic operations and bitwise XOR operation methods are efficient but may be less readable.
- Java 8's Stream API provides a concise way to swap variables but is not commonly used for this purpose.
- Choose the method that best suits your requirements and coding style.

## Arguments

In Java, the `main` method serves as the entry point for a Java program. When you run a Java program, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) invokes the `main` method to start the execution of the program. You can pass command-line arguments to the `main` method when running the program from the command line. Here's a detailed description of passing arguments to the `main` method in Java with examples:

### 1. Syntax:
The `main` method in Java has the following syntax:

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Method body
}
```

### 2. `args` Parameter:
The `args` parameter of the `main` method is an array of type `String[]`. It holds the command-line arguments passed to the program.

### 3. Accessing Command-Line Arguments:
You can access the command-line arguments passed to the program through the `args` array. Each element in the array represents a command-line argument.

#### Example:
```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Printing all command-line arguments
        for (int i = 0; i < args.length; i++) {
            System.out.println("Argument " + (i + 1) + ": " + args[i]);
        }
    }
}
```

### 4. Running a Java Program with Command-Line Arguments:
To run a Java program with command-line arguments, you can pass the arguments after specifying the class name. For example:

```bash
java Main arg1 arg2 arg3
```

### 5. Example with Arguments:
Let's consider a simple example where we want to calculate the sum of integers passed as command-line arguments.

#### Example:
```java
public class SumCalculator {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (String arg : args) {
            sum += Integer.parseInt(arg);
        }
        System.out.println("Sum: " + sum);
    }
}
```

#### Running the Program:
If you run the program with command-line arguments like this:

```bash
java SumCalculator 10 20 30
```

The output will be:

```
Sum: 60
```

### Summary:
- You can pass command-line arguments to the `main` method when running a Java program.
- Command-line arguments are accessed through the `args` array parameter of the `main` method.
- You can iterate over the `args` array to process each command-line argument.
- Command-line arguments are space-separated when passed from the command line.

### More on Arguments

In Java, passing arguments refers to supplying data to a method or constructor when it is invoked. Arguments can be passed to methods and constructors in various ways, including passing primitive data types, objects, arrays, and varargs. Here's a detailed description with examples of passing arguments in Java:

### 1. Passing Primitive Data Types:

#### Example:
```java
public class Example {
    public void printNumber(int num) {
        System.out.println("Number is: " + num);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Example example = new Example();
        example.printNumber(10); // Passing integer argument
    }
}
```

### 2. Passing Objects:

#### Example:
```java
public class Person {
    private String name;

    public Person(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public void greet() {
        System.out.println("Hello, " + name);
    }
}

public class Example {
    public void greetPerson(Person person) {
        person.greet();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Person person = new Person("Alice");
        Example example = new Example();
        example.greetPerson(person); // Passing object argument
    }
}
```

### 3. Passing Arrays:

#### Example:
```java
public class Example {
    public void printArray(int[] arr) {
        for (int num : arr) {
            System.out.print(num + " ");
        }
        System.out.println();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
        Example example = new Example();
        example.printArray(numbers); // Passing array argument
    }
}
```

### 4. Varargs (Variable-Length Arguments):

#### Example:
```java
public class Example {
    public void printNumbers(int... nums) {
        for (int num : nums) {
            System.out.print(num + " ");
        }
        System.out.println();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Example example = new Example();
        example.printNumbers(1, 2, 3); // Passing varargs
        example.printNumbers(4, 5, 6, 7); // Passing varargs
    }
}
```

### Summary:
- Arguments can be passed to methods and constructors in Java to provide data necessary for their execution.
- You can pass primitive data types, objects, arrays, and varargs as arguments.
- Passing arguments enables methods and constructors to operate on specific data provided by the caller, enhancing code flexibility and reusability.


## user input
To get user inputs in Java, you can use the `Scanner` class from the `java.util` package. Here's a detailed explanation with examples:

### 1. Using Scanner Class:

First, import the `Scanner` class at the beginning of your Java file:
```java
import java.util.Scanner;
```

Then, create an instance of the `Scanner` class to read input from the user:
```java
Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
```

### 2. Reading Different Types of Inputs:

#### a. Reading Integers:
```java
System.out.print("Enter an integer: ");
int num = scanner.nextInt();
System.out.println("You entered: " + num);
```

#### b. Reading Floating-Point Numbers:
```java
System.out.print("Enter a floating-point number: ");
double num = scanner.nextDouble();
System.out.println("You entered: " + num);
```

#### c. Reading Strings:
```java
System.out.print("Enter a string: ");
String str = scanner.nextLine();
System.out.println("You entered: " + str);
```

#### d. Reading Characters:
```java
System.out.print("Enter a character: ");
char ch = scanner.next().charAt(0);
System.out.println("You entered: " + ch);
```

### 3. Closing Scanner Object:

It's good practice to close the `Scanner` object once you're done with it:
```java
scanner.close();
```

### Example Program:

Here's a complete example program that reads different types of inputs from the user:
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class UserInputExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Reading an integer
        System.out.print("Enter an integer: ");
        int num = scanner.nextInt();
        System.out.println("You entered: " + num);

        // Reading a floating-point number
        System.out.print("Enter a floating-point number: ");
        double dbl = scanner.nextDouble();
        System.out.println("You entered: " + dbl);

        // Reading a string
        System.out.print("Enter a string: ");
        scanner.nextLine(); // Consuming newline character
        String str = scanner.nextLine();
        System.out.println("You entered: " + str);

        // Reading a character
        System.out.print("Enter a character: ");
        char ch = scanner.next().charAt(0);
        System.out.println("You entered: " + ch);

        // Closing scanner
        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

### Summary:

- Use the `Scanner` class to read user inputs in Java.
- Different methods like `nextInt()`, `nextDouble()`, `nextLine()`, and `next().charAt(0)` can be used to read different types of inputs.
- Don't forget to close the `Scanner` object once you're done with it to release system resources.

## expressions

In Java, an expression is a combination of variables, operators, and method invocations that evaluates to a single value. Expressions can be as simple as a single variable or literal, or they can be complex combinations of multiple sub-expressions. Here's a detailed description of expressions in Java with lots of examples:

### 1. Simple Expressions:
```java
int a = 10; // Variable assignment
int b = 5;
int sum = a + b; // Addition expression
int difference = a - b; // Subtraction expression
```

### 2. Arithmetic Expressions:
```java
int result = 10 * (5 + 3) / 2; // Arithmetic operations
double average = (double) (a + b) / 2; // Type casting and division
int remainder = a % b; // Modulus operation
```

### 3. Relational Expressions:
```java
boolean isEqual = (a == b); // Equality comparison
boolean isGreater = (a > b); // Greater than comparison
boolean isLessThanOrEqual = (a <= b); // Less than or equal comparison
```

### 4. Logical Expressions:
```java
boolean isValid = (a > 0) && (b < 10); // Logical AND operation
boolean isInRange = (a >= 0) || (b <= 100); // Logical OR operation
boolean isNotValid = !(a > b); // Logical NOT operation
```

### 5. Conditional Expressions (Ternary Operator):
```java
int max = (a > b) ? a : b; // Ternary conditional expression
String result = (a % 2 == 0) ? "Even" : "Odd";
```

### 6. Assignment Expressions:
```java
int x = 5;
x += 10; // Compound assignment operator (equivalent to x = x + 10)
x -= 3;
```

### 7. Method Invocation Expressions:
```java
String str = "Hello";
int length = str.length(); // Method invocation expression
String substring = str.substring(1, 3);
```

### 8. Array Access Expressions:
```java
int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
int element = numbers[2]; // Array access expression
numbers[3] = 10;
```

### 9. Object Creation Expressions (Instantiation):
```java
Random random = new Random(); // Object creation expression
StringBuffer buffer = new StringBuffer("Hello");
```

### 10. Precedence and Associativity:
- Java follows operator precedence and associativity rules to evaluate complex expressions.
- Parentheses `()` can be used to override the default precedence and specify the order of evaluation.

### Summary:
- Expressions in Java are combinations of variables, operators, and method invocations that evaluate to a single value.
- They can be arithmetic, relational, logical, conditional, assignment, method invocation, array access, or object creation expressions.
- Understanding expressions is essential for writing Java code, as they form the basis of calculations, comparisons, and data manipulation in programs.


## Math class

double arctanValue = Math.atan(1);            // Outputs: 0.7853981633974483
```

### 5. Rounding and Random Functions:
The `Math` class provides methods for rounding and generating random numbers:
- `Math.round(double a)`: Rounds a floating-point number to the nearest integer.
- `Math.floor(double a)`: Returns the largest integer less than or equal to a.
- `Math.ceil(double a)`: Returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to a.
- `Math.random()`: Returns a random double value between 0.0 (inclusive) and 1.0 (exclusive).

Example:
```java
long roundedValue = Math.round(10.5);    // Outputs: 11
double floorValue = Math.floor(10.7);    // Outputs: 10.0
double ceilValue = Math.ceil(10.2);      // Outputs: 11.0
double randomValue = Math.random();      // Generates a random value between 0.0 and 1.0
```

### Summary:
The `Math` class in Java provides a wide range of mathematical functions and constants for performing common mathematical operations. By utilizing these methods, you can efficiently perform mathematical calculations in your Java programs.

| `toLowerCase()`                    | Converts all of the characters in this string to lowercase.               |
| `toUpperCase()`                    | Converts all of the characters in this string to uppercase.               |
| `trim()`                           | Returns a copy of the string, with leading and trailing whitespace removed. |
| `valueOf(int i)`                   | Returns the string representation of the `int` argument.                  |

These are just some of the methods available in the `String` class. Java's `String` class provides a comprehensive set of methods for manipulating strings, making it a powerful tool for string processing in Java programs.

The `String` class in Java is one of the most commonly used classes, providing a convenient way to work with strings of characters. It is part of the `java.lang` package and is automatically imported into every Java program. Here's a detailed description of the `String` class in Java with lots of examples:

### 1. Creating Strings:
Strings can be created using string literals or by using the `new` keyword to instantiate a `String` object.

Example:
```java
String str1 = "Hello";              // Using string literal
String str2 = new String("World");  // Using new keyword
```

### 2. String Concatenation:
Strings can be concatenated using the `+` operator or the `concat()` method.

Example:
```java
String message = str1 + ", " + str2;          // Using +
String concatenated = str1.concat(", ").concat(str2);  // Using concat()
```

### 3. String Length:
The `length()` method returns the length of the string.

Example:
```java
int length = str1.length();  // length is 5
```

### 4. Accessing Characters:
Individual characters in a string can be accessed using the `charAt()` method.

Example:
```java
char firstChar = str1.charAt(0);  // firstChar is 'H'
```

### 5. Substrings:
The `substring()` method returns a substring of the original string.

Example:
```java
String sub = str1.substring(2);          // sub is "llo"
String sub2 = str1.substring(1, 4);      // sub2 is "ell"
```

### 6. Comparing Strings:
Strings can be compared using the `equals()` method for content equality and `compareTo()` method for lexicographic comparison.

Example:
```java
boolean isEqual = str1.equals("Hello");        // true
int compareResult = str1.compareTo(str2);      // Negative, zero, or positive integer
```

### 7. Case Manipulation:
Strings can be converted to lowercase or uppercase using `toLowerCase()` and `toUpperCase()` methods.

Example:
```java
String lowercase = str1.toLowerCase();    // lowercase is "hello"
String uppercase = str2.toUpperCase();    // uppercase is "WORLD"
```

### 8. Searching and Replacing:
The `indexOf()` method returns the index of the first occurrence of a substring, and `replace()` method replaces occurrences of a specified substring.

Example:
```java
int index = str1.indexOf("lo");            // index is 3
String replaced = str1.replace("l", "L");  // replaced is "HeLLo"
```

### 9. Trimming:
The `trim()` method removes leading and trailing whitespace from the string.

Example:
```java
String padded = "   Hello   ";
String trimmed = padded.trim();            // trimmed is "Hello"
```

### 10. Splitting:
The `split()` method splits a string into an array of substrings based on a delimiter.

Example:
```java
String sentence = "Java is awesome";
String[] words = sentence.split(" ");      // words is {"Java", "is", "awesome"}
```

### Summary:
- The `String` class in Java provides many methods for manipulating strings, including creating, concatenating, comparing, and searching.
- Strings are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed after creation.
- Understanding the methods available in the `String` class is essential for effective string manipulation in Java programs.

## random numbers

Random number generation in Java is facilitated by the `java.util.Random` class, which provides methods for generating random numbers of various types. It offers flexibility and control over random number generation. Here's a detailed description with lots of examples:

### 1. Basic Random Number Generation:
The `java.util.Random` class provides methods to generate random numbers of different data types.

#### Example:
```java
import java.util.Random;

Random random = new Random();
int randomNumber = random.nextInt(); // Generates a random integer
double randomDouble = random.nextDouble(); // Generates a random double between 0.0 (inclusive) and 1.0 (exclusive)
```

### 2. Generating Random Numbers within a Specific Range:
You can generate random numbers within a specific range by using the appropriate method overload.

#### Example:
```java
int min = 1;
int max = 100;
int randomInRange = random.nextInt(max - min + 1) + min; // Generates a random integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive)
```

### 3. Setting a Seed Value:
You can initialize the random number generator with a seed value. Setting the same seed value ensures reproducibility of random sequences.

#### Example:
```java
Random seededRandom = new Random(123); // Seed value of 123
int seededRandomNumber = seededRandom.nextInt(); // Generates a random integer using the seeded random number generator
```

### 4. Generating Random Numbers of Other Types:
The `Random` class also provides methods for generating random numbers of other types such as `long`, `float`, and `boolean`.

#### Example:
```java
long randomLong = random.nextLong(); // Generates a random long value
float randomFloat = random.nextFloat(); // Generates a random float value between 0.0 (inclusive) and 1.0 (exclusive)
boolean randomBoolean = random.nextBoolean(); // Generates a random boolean value
```

### 5. Generating Random Bytes:
You can generate an array of random bytes using the `nextBytes(byte[] bytes)` method.

#### Example:
```java
byte[] randomBytes = new byte[10];
random.nextBytes(randomBytes); // Fills the array with random bytes
```

### Summary:
- The `java.util.Random` class in Java provides methods for generating random numbers of various types.
- You can generate random numbers within a specific range, set a seed value for reproducibility, and generate random numbers of other types.
- Random number generation is useful in scenarios such as simulations, cryptography, gaming, and statistical analysis.


# Chapter 2 flow control

Here's a table describing the control flow statements in Java with their descriptions:

| Control Flow Statement | Description                                                                                                               |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `if-else`              | Executes a block of code if a specified condition is true. Otherwise, executes another block of code.                   |
| `switch`               | Evaluates an expression and executes code blocks based on matching case values.                                         |
| `while`                | Executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.                                                        |
| `do-while`             | Similar to `while`, but executes the block of code at least once before checking the condition.                          |
| `for`                  | Executes a block of code a specified number of times.                                                                      |
| `break`                | Terminates the loop or switch statement and transfers control to the statement following the terminated loop or switch.   |
| `continue`             | Skips the current iteration of a loop and proceeds with the next iteration.                                                |
| `return`               | Exits from the current method and returns a value to the caller.                                                            |

### Descriptions:

1. **`if-else`**: It's used for decision-making. If the condition evaluates to true, the code inside the `if` block is executed; otherwise, the code inside the `else` block is executed.

2. **`switch`**: It evaluates an expression and executes code blocks based on matching case values. It's useful when you have multiple options to choose from.

3. **`while`**: It repeats a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. It's useful for looping when you don't know in advance how many times the code should iterate.

4. **`do-while`**: Similar to `while`, but it guarantees that the block of code is executed at least once before checking the condition.

5. **`for`**: It's a compact way of writing the `while` loop when the number of iterations is known. It includes initialization, condition, and iteration expression within a single line.

6. **`break`**: It terminates the loop or switch statement and transfers control to the statement following the terminated loop or switch. It's useful for prematurely exiting a loop.

7. **`continue`**: It skips the current iteration of a loop and proceeds with the next iteration. It's useful when you want to skip specific iterations without terminating the loop.

8. **`return`**: It exits from the current method and returns a value to the caller. It's used to return a value from a method.

These control flow statements provide the basic building blocks for writing flexible and powerful programs in Java. They allow you to control the flow of execution based on different conditions and requirements.

## if statements
The `if` statement in Java is a fundamental control flow statement that allows you to execute a block of code conditionally based on the evaluation of a boolean expression. It helps in making decisions within a program by executing specific code only if the condition is true. Here's a detailed description of the `if` statement with lots of examples:

### Syntax:
```java
if (condition) {
    // Code block to be executed if the condition is true
}
```

### 1. Basic `if` Statement:
```java
int num = 10;
if (num > 0) {
    System.out.println("Number is positive");
}
```

### 2. `if-else` Statement:
```java
int num = -5;
if (num > 0) {
    System.out.println("Number is positive");
} else {
    System.out.println("Number is non-positive");
}
```

### 3. `if-else-if` Statement:
```java
int num = 0;
if (num > 0) {
    System.out.println("Number is positive");
} else if (num < 0) {
    System.out.println("Number is negative");
} else {
    System.out.println("Number is zero");
}
```

### 4. Nested `if` Statement:
```java
int num = 10;
if (num > 0) {
    if (num % 2 == 0) {
        System.out.println("Number is positive and even");
    } else {
        System.out.println("Number is positive and odd");
    }
}
```

### 5. `if` Statement with Logical Operators:
```java
int num = 15;
if (num > 0 && num % 2 == 0) {
    System.out.println("Number is positive and even");
}
```

### 6. `if` Statement with Ternary Operator:
```java
int num = 10;
String result = (num % 2 == 0) ? "even" : "odd";
System.out.println("Number is " + result);
```

### 7. `if` Statement with Block:
```java
int num = 20;
if (num > 0) {
    System.out.println("Number is positive");
    num *= 2;
    System.out.println("Doubled number: " + num);
}
```

### 8. `if` Statement with Multiple Conditions:
```java
int age = 25;
String gender = "male";
if (age >= 18 && gender.equals("male")) {
    System.out.println("You are eligible for voting");
}
```

### 9. `if` Statement with Method Call:
```java
int num = -10;
if (isPositive(num)) {
    System.out.println("Number is positive");
}

// Method definition
public static boolean isPositive(int num) {
    return num > 0;
}
```

### Summary:
- The `if` statement in Java allows for conditional execution of code blocks based on the evaluation of a boolean expression.
- It can be used alone, in conjunction with `else` and `else-if` clauses, or nested within other control flow statements.
- `if` statements can include logical operators, ternary operators, blocks of code, multiple conditions, and method calls to make complex decisions within a program.
- Proper use of `if` statements is essential for implementing logic and decision-making in Java programs.

## Logical Operators
In Java, logical operators are used to perform logical operations on boolean expressions. These operators allow you to combine multiple conditions and evaluate them to produce a single boolean result. There are three logical operators in Java: `&&` (logical AND), `||` (logical OR), and `!` (logical NOT). Here's a detailed description of each logical operator with lots of examples:

### 1. Logical AND (`&&`):
- The logical AND operator returns true if both operands are true, otherwise, it returns false.
- It evaluates the second operand only if the first operand is true.

#### Example:
```java
int age = 25;
boolean isAdult = true;

if (age >= 18 && isAdult) {
    System.out.println("You are an adult.");
}
```

### 2. Logical OR (`||`):
- The logical OR operator returns true if at least one of the operands is true, otherwise, it returns false.
- It evaluates the second operand only if the first operand is false.

#### Example:
```java
int temperature = 25;

if (temperature > 30 || temperature < 0) {
    System.out.println("Extreme temperature alert!");
}
```

### 3. Logical NOT (`!`):
- The logical NOT operator reverses the logical state of its operand. If the operand is true, it returns false, and if the operand is false, it returns true.

#### Example:
```java
boolean isRaining = true;

if (!isRaining) {
    System.out.println("It's not raining.");
}
```

### 4. Short-Circuit Evaluation:
- Java uses short-circuit evaluation for logical AND (`&&`) and logical OR (`||`) operators.
- In a logical AND operation, if the first operand is false, the second operand is not evaluated because the overall result will be false regardless of the second operand's value.
- In a logical OR operation, if the first operand is true, the second operand is not evaluated because the overall result will be true regardless of the second operand's value.

#### Example:
```java
int x = 5;
int y = 10;

if (x > 0 && y/x > 2) {
    System.out.println("Condition is true.");
}
```
In the above example, `y/x` is not evaluated because `x` is not greater than 0, so the overall condition is false.

### Summary:
- Logical operators are used to perform logical operations on boolean expressions.
- `&&` (logical AND) returns true if both operands are true.
- `||` (logical OR) returns true if at least one operand is true.
- `!` (logical NOT) reverses the logical state of its operand.
- Short-circuit evaluation improves performance by avoiding unnecessary evaluations.

## switches
The switch statement in Java is used to select one of many code blocks to be executed. It provides a cleaner alternative to multiple nested if-else statements when you have multiple conditions to check against a single value. Here's a detailed description of the switch statement in Java with lots of examples:

### Syntax:
```java
switch (expression) {
    case value1:
        // Code block to be executed if expression matches value1
        break;
    case value2:
        // Code block to be executed if expression matches value2
        break;
    // More case statements
    default:
        // Code block to be executed if none of the cases match
}
```

### Explanation:
- The `switch` keyword initiates the switch statement.
- The `expression` is evaluated once and compared with the values of each `case`.
- If a match is found, the corresponding code block is executed.
- The `break` statement is used to terminate the switch statement. Without it, execution will "fall through" to the next case.
- The `default` case is optional and is executed if none of the cases match.

### Example 1: Simple Switch Statement
```java
int day = 3;
String dayName;

switch (day) {
    case 1:
        dayName = "Sunday";
        break;
    case 2:
        dayName = "Monday";
        break;
    case 3:
        dayName = "Tuesday";
        break;
    // More cases for other days
    default:
        dayName = "Invalid day";
}
System.out.println("The day is: " + dayName); // Outputs: The day is: Tuesday
```

### Example 2: Switch Statement without Breaks
```java
int number = 2;

switch (number) {
    case 1:
    case 2:
        System.out.println("Number is either 1 or 2");
        break;
    case 3:
        System.out.println("Number is 3");
        break;
    default:
        System.out.println("Number is not 1, 2, or 3");
}
// Outputs: Number is either 1 or 2
```

### Example 3: Using Enum in Switch Statement
```java
enum Day {
    SUNDAY, MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY
}

Day today = Day.TUESDAY;

switch (today) {
    case MONDAY:
    case TUESDAY:
    case WEDNESDAY:
    case THURSDAY:
    case FRIDAY:
        System.out.println("It's a weekday");
        break;
    case SATURDAY:
    case SUNDAY:
        System.out.println("It's a weekend");
        break;
}
// Outputs: It's a weekday
```

### Summary:
- The switch statement in Java provides a more efficient and readable way to handle multiple conditional branches based on a single expression.
- It can be used with primitive data types (int, char, etc.), enums, and even strings (since Java 7).
- Each case label must be a constant expression (literal value or final variable).
- The switch statement is a powerful tool for simplifying code and making it more structured and maintainable.

## while loop
The while loop in Java is a control flow statement that repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. It's used when the number of iterations is not known beforehand and the loop needs to continue until a certain condition is met. Here's a detailed description of the while loop in Java with lots of examples:

### Syntax:
```java
while (condition) {
    // Code block to be executed while the condition is true
}
```

### Explanation:
- The `while` keyword initiates the while loop.
- The `condition` is a boolean expression. If it evaluates to true, the code block inside the loop is executed; otherwise, the loop terminates.
- The code block is executed repeatedly as long as the condition remains true.
- It's important to ensure that the condition eventually becomes false to avoid an infinite loop.

### Example 1: Basic while Loop
```java
int count = 1;

while (count <= 5) {
    System.out.println("Count: " + count);
    count++; // Increment the counter
}
```
Output:
```
Count: 1
Count: 2
Count: 3
Count: 4
Count: 5
```

### Example 2: Using while Loop to Calculate Factorial
```java
int number = 5;
int factorial = 1;
int i = 1;

while (i <= number) {
    factorial *= i; // Multiply factorial by current value of i
    i++; // Increment i
}

System.out.println("Factorial of " + number + " is: " + factorial);
// Output: Factorial of 5 is: 120
```

### Example 3: Infinite Loop with while Loop
```java
while (true) {
    // This loop will continue indefinitely until manually terminated
    System.out.println("This is an infinite loop!");
}
```

### Example 4: Using while Loop to Iterate over Arrays
```java
int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
int index = 0;

while (index < numbers.length) {
    System.out.println("Element at index " + index + ": " + numbers[index]);
    index++;
}
```
Output:
```
Element at index 0: 1
Element at index 1: 2
Element at index 2: 3
Element at index 3: 4
Element at index 4: 5
```

### Summary:
- The while loop in Java is used to repeatedly execute a block of code while a specified condition remains true.
- It's suitable for situations where the number of iterations is not known beforehand.
- Be cautious of creating infinite loops by ensuring that the condition eventually becomes false.
- The while loop is a fundamental building block in programming and is widely used for tasks such as iteration, counting, and condition-based processing.

## for loop

The for loop in Java is a control flow statement that allows you to iterate over a range of values or elements in a collection. It's commonly used when the number of iterations is known beforehand or when iterating over arrays, lists, or other data structures. Here's a detailed description of the for loop in Java with lots of examples:

### Syntax:
```java
for (initialization; condition; update) {
    // Code block to be executed in each iteration
}
```

### Explanation:
- The `for` keyword initiates the for loop.
- The `initialization` statement is executed before the loop starts. It's typically used to initialize loop control variables.
- The `condition` is a boolean expression. If it evaluates to true, the code block inside the loop is executed; otherwise, the loop terminates.
- The `update` statement is executed after each iteration. It's typically used to update loop control variables.
- The code block inside the loop is executed repeatedly as long as the condition remains true.

### Example 1: Basic for Loop
```java
for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    System.out.println("Count: " + i);
}
```
Output:
```
Count: 1
Count: 2
Count: 3
Count: 4
Count: 5
```

### Example 2: Using for Loop to Calculate Factorial
```java
int number = 5;
int factorial = 1;

for (int i = 1; i <= number; i++) {
    factorial *= i; // Multiply factorial by current value of i
}

System.out.println("Factorial of " + number + " is: " + factorial);
// Output: Factorial of 5 is: 120
```

### Example 3: Nested for Loop for Matrix Multiplication
```java
int[][] matrixA = { {1, 2}, {3, 4} };
int[][] matrixB = { {5, 6}, {7, 8} };
int[][] result = new int[2][2];

for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < 2; j++) {
        for (int k = 0; k < 2; k++) {
            result[i][j] += matrixA[i][k] * matrixB[k][j];
        }
    }
}

// Displaying the result
for (int[] row : result) {
    for (int value : row) {
        System.out.print(value + " ");
    }
    System.out.println();
}
```
Output:
```
19 22
43 50
```

### Example 4: Using for Loop to Iterate over Arrays
```java
int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

for (int number : numbers) {
    System.out.println("Number: " + number);
}
```
Output:
```
Number: 1
Number: 2
Number: 3
Number: 4
Number: 5
```

### Summary:
- The for loop in Java provides a concise and efficient way to iterate over a range of values or elements in a collection.
- It's suitable for situations where the number of iterations is known beforehand.
- The initialization, condition, and update statements are all optional and can be omitted if not needed.
- The for loop is a powerful tool for tasks such as iteration, counting, and processing elements in arrays or collections.


## nested loops
## Break, Continue, and return

The for loop in Java is a control flow statement that allows you to iterate over a range of values or elements in a collection. It's commonly used when the number of iterations is known beforehand or when iterating over arrays, lists, or other data structures. Here's a detailed description of the for loop in Java with lots of examples:

### Syntax:
```java
for (initialization; condition; update) {
    // Code block to be executed in each iteration
}
```

### Explanation:
- The `for` keyword initiates the for loop.
- The `initialization` statement is executed before the loop starts. It's typically used to initialize loop control variables.
- The `condition` is a boolean expression. If it evaluates to true, the code block inside the loop is executed; otherwise, the loop terminates.
- The `update` statement is executed after each iteration. It's typically used to update loop control variables.
- The code block inside the loop is executed repeatedly as long as the condition remains true.

### Example 1: Basic for Loop
```java
for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    System.out.println("Count: " + i);
}
```
Output:
```
Count: 1
Count: 2
Count: 3
Count: 4
Count: 5
```

### Example 2: Using for Loop to Calculate Factorial
```java
int number = 5;
int factorial = 1;

for (int i = 1; i <= number; i++) {
    factorial *= i; // Multiply factorial by current value of i
}

System.out.println("Factorial of " + number + " is: " + factorial);
// Output: Factorial of 5 is: 120
```

### Example 3: Nested for Loop for Matrix Multiplication
```java
int[][] matrixA = { {1, 2}, {3, 4} };
int[][] matrixB = { {5, 6}, {7, 8} };
int[][] result = new int[2][2];

for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < 2; j++) {
        for (int k = 0; k < 2; k++) {
            result[i][j] += matrixA[i][k] * matrixB[k][j];
        }
    }
}

// Displaying the result
for (int[] row : result) {
    for (int value : row) {
        System.out.print(value + " ");
    }
    System.out.println();
}
```
Output:
```
19 22
43 50
```

### Example 4: Using for Loop to Iterate over Arrays
```java
int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

for (int number : numbers) {
    System.out.println("Number: " + number);
}
```
Output:
```
Number: 1
Number: 2
Number: 3
Number: 4
Number: 5
```

### Summary:
- The for loop in Java provides a concise and efficient way to iterate over a range of values or elements in a collection.
- It's suitable for situations where the number of iterations is known beforehand.
- The initialization, condition, and update statements are all optional and can be omitted if not needed.
- The for loop is a powerful tool for tasks such as iteration, counting, and processing elements in arrays or collections.

|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Arrays             | Arrays are ordered collections of elements of the same data type with a fixed size.                   |
| Lists              | Lists are ordered collections of elements that allow duplicates and provide dynamic resizing.          |
| Sets               | Sets are collections of unique elements that do not allow duplicates.                                |

In Java, complex data types refer to non-primitive data types that can hold multiple values and have various functionalities beyond simple storage. These complex data types include arrays, collections (such as lists, sets, and maps), and user-defined classes. Let's delve into each of them with examples:

1. **Arrays**:
   - Arrays in Java are used to store multiple values of the same data type under a single variable name.
   - They have a fixed size once declared and can hold primitive or object types.
   - Arrays are declared using square brackets `[]`.
   - Example:
     ```java
     // Array of integers
     int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

     // Array of strings
     String[] names = {"Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"};
     ```

2. **Lists**:
   - Lists are part of the Java Collection Framework and provide dynamic resizing.
   - They can hold elements of different data types and allow duplicates.
   - Common implementations include ArrayList and LinkedList.
   - Example:
     ```java
     // ArrayList of integers
     ArrayList<Integer> numbersList = new ArrayList<>();
     numbersList.add(10);
     numbersList.add(20);
     numbersList.add(30);

     // ArrayList of strings
     ArrayList<String> namesList = new ArrayList<>();
     namesList.add("Alice");
     namesList.add("Bob");
     namesList.add("Charlie");
     ```

3. **Sets**:
   - Sets are collections that do not allow duplicate elements.
   - They can be useful for tasks where uniqueness is important.
   - Common implementations include HashSet and TreeSet.
   - Example:
     ```java
     // HashSet of integers
     HashSet<Integer> numberSet = new HashSet<>();
     numberSet.add(10);
     numberSet.add(20);
     numberSet.add(10); // This won't be added since it's a duplicate

     // HashSet of strings
     HashSet<String> nameSet = new HashSet<>();
     nameSet.add("Alice");
     nameSet.add("Bob");
     nameSet.add("Alice"); // This won't be added
     ```

4. **Maps**:
   - Maps are collections that store key-value pairs.
   - Each key must be unique, but values can be duplicated.
   - Common implementations include HashMap and TreeMap.
   - Example:
     ```java
     // HashMap with String keys and Integer values
     HashMap<String, Integer> ageMap = new HashMap<>();
     ageMap.put("Alice", 30);
     ageMap.put("Bob", 25);
     ageMap.put("Charlie", 35);

     // Accessing value by key
     int ageOfAlice = ageMap.get("Alice"); // Returns 30
     ```

5. **User-defined Classes**:
   - Java allows you to define your own classes, enabling you to create complex data structures tailored to your specific needs.
   - Example:
     ```java
     // User-defined class representing a Person
     class Person {
         String name;
         int age;

         // Constructor
         public Person(String name, int age) {
             this.name = name;
             this.age = age;
         }
     }

     // Creating instances of the Person class
     Person person1 = new Person("Alice", 30);
     Person person2 = new Person("Bob", 25);
     ```

These complex data types provide flexibility and power in Java programming, allowing you to work with structured data efficiently.

# Chapter 4 Object Oriented Programming

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties) and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods). Java is a fully object-oriented programming language, and OOP plays a fundamental role in Java development. Here's a detailed description of object-oriented programming in Java:

1. **Classes and Objects**:
   - In Java, everything is encapsulated within classes and objects. A class is a blueprint for creating objects, defining their structure and behavior. An object is an instance of a class.
   - Example:
     ```java
     // Defining a class
     class Car {
         // Fields
         String brand;
         int year;

         // Constructor
         public Car(String brand, int year) {
             this.brand = brand;
             this.year = year;
         }

         // Method
         public void drive() {
             System.out.println("Driving the " + brand);
         }
     }

     // Creating objects of the class Car
     Car car1 = new Car("Toyota", 2020);
     Car car2 = new Car("Honda", 2019);
     ```

2. **Encapsulation**:
   - Encapsulation is the bundling of data and methods that operate on the data within a single unit, typically, a class.
   - Access to the data and methods is controlled by access modifiers such as `public`, `private`, and `protected`.
   - Example:
     ```java
     class Circle {
         private double radius;

         public Circle(double radius) {
             this.radius = radius;
         }

         public double getRadius() {
             return radius;
         }

         public double calculateArea() {
             return Math.PI * radius * radius;
         }
     }
     ```

3. **Inheritance**:
   - Inheritance allows a class (subclass or child class) to inherit properties and behavior from another class (superclass or parent class).
   - It promotes code reusability and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.
   - Example:
     ```java
     // Superclass
     class Animal {
         public void eat() {
             System.out.println("Animal is eating");
         }
     }

     // Subclass inheriting from Animal
     class Dog extends Animal {
         public void bark() {
             System.out.println("Dog is barking");
         }
     }
     ```

4. **Polymorphism**:
   - Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.
   - It enables methods to be overridden in subclasses to provide specific implementations.
   - Example:
     ```java
     // Superclass
     class Shape {
         public void draw() {
             System.out.println("Drawing a shape");
         }
     }

     // Subclass overriding the draw method
     class Circle extends Shape {
         @Override
         public void draw() {
             System.out.println("Drawing a circle");
         }
     }
     ```

5. **Abstraction**:
   - Abstraction is the process of hiding the implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object.
   - Abstract classes and interfaces are used to achieve abstraction in Java.
   - Example:
     ```java
     // Abstract class
     abstract class Shape {
         abstract void draw();
     }
     ```

Object-oriented programming in Java provides a structured approach to software development, promoting modularity, flexibility, and maintainability of code. It enables developers to model real-world entities and relationships effectively, making it a powerful paradigm for building robust and scalable applications.

## Object Orietned programming characteristics

Sure, here's a table describing the characteristics of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java:

| Characteristic         | Description                                                                                                                                                          |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Abstraction            | Abstraction focuses on hiding the implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. It allows you to create a simplified view of the system.                                                    |
| Encapsulation          | Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (behavior) that operate on the data into a single unit called a class. It restricts access to the internal state of an object and only exposes necessary methods.  |
| Inheritance            | Inheritance allows a class (subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and behavior from another class (superclass or base class). It promotes code reusability and establishes an "is-a" relationship between classes.             |
| Polymorphism           | Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables methods to be invoked dynamically at runtime, depending on the actual object type.                                 |
| Classes and Objects    | Classes are templates or blueprints for creating objects. Objects are instances of classes that encapsulate data and behavior. They interact with each other through method calls.                                                     |
| Message Passing        | Objects communicate with each other by sending and receiving messages. Message passing enables objects to collaborate and perform tasks.                                                                                      |
| Modularity             | Modularity refers to breaking down a program into smaller, manageable, and reusable components (classes). It enhances code organization, maintenance, and reusability.                                                          |
| Polymorphism           | Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables methods to be invoked dynamically at runtime, depending on the actual object type.                                 |

These characteristics are fundamental concepts in Object-Oriented Programming and are crucial for designing robust, maintainable, and scalable software systems.

## objects (OOP)

In Java, an object is an instance of a class. It encapsulates data (attributes) and behaviors (methods) related to a specific entity. Here's a detailed explanation of objects in Java along with examples:

### 1. Object Creation:
   - Objects are created using the `new` keyword followed by a constructor call.
   - Example:
     ```java
     // Creating an object of the String class
     String myString = new String("Hello, World!");
     ```

### 2. Object Initialization:
   - Objects are initialized using constructors.
   - Constructors are special methods within a class used to initialize objects.
   - Example:
     ```java
     // Constructor of the String class initializes the object
     String myString = new String("Hello, World!");
     ```

### 3. Accessing Object Members:
   - You can access the members (fields and methods) of an object using the dot `.` operator.
   - Example:
     ```java
     // Accessing a method of the String class object
     int length = myString.length();
     ```

### 4. Object Comparison:
   - You can compare objects using the `equals()` method (for content-based comparison) or using the `==` operator (for reference-based comparison).
   - Example:
     ```java
     String str1 = new String("Hello");
     String str2 = new String("Hello");

     boolean isEqual = str1.equals(str2);  // true, content-based comparison
     boolean isSameObject = (str1 == str2); // false, reference-based comparison
     ```

### 5. Object Cloning:
   - You can create a copy of an object using the `clone()` method.
   - Example:
     ```java
     String original = new String("Original");
     String copy = original.clone();
     ```

### 6. Passing Objects as Arguments:
   - Objects can be passed as arguments to methods.
   - Example:
     ```java
     public void printString(String str) {
         System.out.println(str);
     }

     // Passing an object as an argument
     printString(myString);
     ```

### 7. Returning Objects from Methods:
   - Methods can return objects.
   - Example:
     ```java
     public String concatenateStrings(String str1, String str2) {
         return str1 + str2;
     }

     // Returning an object from a method
     String concatenatedString = concatenateStrings("Hello", "World");
     ```

### 8. Object Destruction:
   - Java manages memory automatically through garbage collection.
   - When no references to an object exist, it becomes eligible for garbage collection.
   - Example:
     ```java
     String myString = new String("Hello, World!");
     myString = null; // Object becomes eligible for garbage collection
     ```

Objects in Java serve as the building blocks for creating complex data structures and applications. They enable the modeling of real-world entities and facilitate the implementation of object-oriented principles like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

In Java, objects are instances of classes. They represent real-world entities, concepts, or things in a software application. Objects encapsulate data (attributes) and behaviors (methods) related to a specific entity. Here's a detailed explanation of objects in Java with examples:

### 1. Object Creation:
   - Objects are created using the `new` keyword followed by a constructor call.
   - Example:
     ```java
     // Creating an object of the String class
     String myString = new String("Hello, World!");
     ```

### 2. Object Initialization:
   - Objects are initialized using constructors.
   - Constructors are special methods within a class used to initialize objects.
   - Example:
     ```java
     // Constructor of the String class initializes the object
     String myString = new String("Hello, World!");
     ```

### 3. Accessing Object Members:
   - You can access the members (fields and methods) of an object using the dot `.` operator.
   - Example:
     ```java
     // Accessing a method of the String class object
     int length = myString.length();
     ```

### 4. Object Comparison:
   - You can compare objects using the `equals()` method (for content-based comparison) or using the `==` operator (for reference-based comparison).
   - Example:
     ```java
     String str1 = new String("Hello");
     String str2 = new String("Hello");

     boolean isEqual = str1.equals(str2);  // true, content-based comparison
     boolean isSameObject = (str1 == str2); // false, reference-based comparison
     ```

### 5. Object Cloning:
   - You can create a copy of an object using the `clone()` method.
   - Example:
     ```java
     String original = new String("Original");
     String copy = original.clone();
     ```

### 6. Passing Objects as Arguments:
   - Objects can be passed as arguments to methods.
   - Example:
     ```java
     public void printString(String str) {
         System.out.println(str);
     }

     // Passing an object as an argument
     printString(myString);
     ```

### 7. Returning Objects from Methods:
   - Methods can return objects.
   - Example:
     ```java
     public String concatenateStrings(String str1, String str2) {
         return str1 + str2;
     }

     // Returning an object from a method
     String concatenatedString = concatenateStrings("Hello", "World");
     ```

### 8. Object Destruction:
   - Java manages memory automatically through garbage collection.
   - When no references to an object exist, it becomes eligible for garbage collection.
   - Example:
     ```java
     String myString = new String("Hello, World!");
     myString = null; // Object becomes eligible for garbage collection
     ```

Objects in Java play a central role in object-oriented programming, enabling developers to model complex systems and implement design patterns effectively. They provide a way to structure code, promote code reuse, and facilitate modular programming. Through objects, Java programs can represent and manipulate data in a structured and organized manner.

## Class vs. Objects

In Java, both objects and classes are fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming, but they serve different purposes.

### Class:
- A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects.
- It defines the attributes (data fields) and behaviors (methods) that objects of that class will have.
- Classes act as a blueprint from which objects are instantiated.
- Classes encapsulate the common properties and behaviors of objects.
- Example:
  ```java
  // Class definition
  public class Car {
      // Attributes
      String make;
      String model;
      int year;

      // Constructor
      public Car(String make, String model, int year) {
          this.make = make;
          this.model = model;
          this.year = year;
      }

      // Method
      public void start() {
          System.out.println("The car is starting...");
      }
  }
  ```

### Object:
- An object is an instance of a class.
- It represents a real-world entity and has state (attributes) and behavior (methods).
- Objects are created based on the blueprint defined by the class.
- Each object has its own set of attributes and can invoke methods defined in its class.
- Example:
  ```java
  // Creating an object of the Car class
  Car myCar = new Car("Toyota", "Camry", 2022);
  ```

### Key Differences:
- **Class**: A class is a blueprint or template that defines the structure and behavior of objects.
- **Object**: An object is an instance of a class created at runtime.
- **Class**: Defines attributes and behaviors.
- **Object**: Contains specific data and can perform actions.
- **Class**: Serves as a template for creating multiple objects with similar properties and behaviors.
- **Object**: Represents a single instance of a class with its own state and behavior.

In summary, classes provide the structure and blueprint for creating objects, while objects are the instances of those classes with specific attributes and behaviors. Classes define what an object will be, while objects represent actual instances of that definition.

## methods

In Java, methods are functions defined within classes that encapsulate behavior and allow for code reuse. They are a fundamental building block of object-oriented programming. Here's a detailed explanation of methods in Java with examples:

### 1. Method Declaration:
- A method declaration consists of a method signature followed by the method body enclosed in curly braces `{}`.
- The method signature includes the access modifier, return type, method name, parameters (if any), and optional exceptions thrown.
- Example:
  ```java
  public int add(int a, int b) {
      return a + b;
  }
  ```

### 2. Access Modifiers:
- Access modifiers control the visibility and accessibility of methods.
- There are four access modifiers: `public`, `protected`, `default` (no modifier), and `private`.
- Example:
  ```java
  public void publicMethod() {
      // Accessible from anywhere
  }

  private void privateMethod() {
      // Accessible only within the same class
  }
  ```

### 3. Return Type:
- The return type specifies the type of value returned by the method.
- If a method does not return any value, its return type is `void`.
- Example:
  ```java
  public int add(int a, int b) {
      return a + b;
  }

  public void greet() {
      System.out.println("Hello!");
  }
  ```

### 4. Parameters:
- Parameters are variables declared within the parentheses of a method's declaration.
- They represent values that are passed to the method when it is called.
- Example:
  ```java
  public void printMessage(String message) {
      System.out.println(message);
  }
  ```

### 5. Method Overloading:
- Method overloading allows multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists.
- Methods can be overloaded based on the number, types, or order of parameters.
- Example:
  ```java
  public int add(int a, int b) {
      return a + b;
  }

  public double add(double a, double b) {
      return a + b;
  }
  ```

### 6. Method Overriding:
- Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass.
- It is used for achieving runtime polymorphism.
- Example:
  ```java
  class Animal {
      public void sound() {
          System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
      }
  }

  class Dog extends Animal {
      @Override
      public void sound() {
          System.out.println("Dog barks");
      }
  }
  ```

### 7. Static Methods:
- Static methods belong to the class rather than any specific instance of the class.
- They can be called directly using the class name without creating an object.
- Example:
  ```java
  public static int multiply(int a, int b) {
      return a * b;
  }
  ```

### 8. Instance Methods:
- Instance methods are associated with objects of the class and can access instance variables.
- They are called on instances of the class and can modify the state of the object.
- Example:
  ```java
  public void setName(String name) {
      this.name = name;
  }
  ```

### 9. Recursive Methods:
- Recursive methods are methods that call themselves to solve a smaller instance of the same problem.
- They are useful for solving problems that can be broken down into smaller, similar subproblems.
- Example:
  ```java
  public int factorial(int n) {
      if (n == 0 || n == 1) {
          return 1;
      } else {
          return n * factorial(n - 1);
      }
  }
  ```

### 10. Method Chaining:
- Method chaining involves invoking multiple methods on the same object in a single line.
- It enhances readability and conciseness of code.
- Example:
  ```java
  String result = str.trim().toUpperCase().substring(0, 5);
  ```

Methods in Java provide a way to encapsulate behavior, promote code reuse, and improve the organization and readability of code. Understanding how to define, call, and utilize methods is essential for writing effective Java programs.


## Instance variable
In Java, instance variables are attributes or fields declared within a class but outside of any method, constructor, or block. They represent the state of an object and are unique to each instance of the class. Here's a detailed explanation of instance variables in Java with examples:

### 1. Declaration and Initialization:
   - Instance variables are declared with an access modifier (public, private, protected, or default), followed by the data type and the variable name.
   - They are typically initialized within constructors or directly at the point of declaration.
   - Example:
     ```java
     public class Car {
         // Instance variables
         private String make;
         private String model;
         private int year;

         // Constructor initializes instance variables
         public Car(String make, String model, int year) {
             this.make = make;
             this.model = model;
             this.year = year;
         }
     }
     ```

### 2. Accessing Instance Variables:
   - Instance variables are accessed using the dot `.` operator on an object of the class.
   - Example:
     ```java
     Car myCar = new Car("Toyota", "Camry", 2022);
     String carMake = myCar.make;
     int carYear = myCar.year;
     ```

### 3. Scope:
   - Instance variables are accessible throughout the class in which they are declared.
   - They have class-level scope and are visible to all methods within the class.
   - Example:
     ```java
     public class Car {
         private String make; // Instance variable

         public void setMake(String make) {
             this.make = make; // Accessing instance variable
         }
     }
     ```

### 4. Default Initialization:
   - Instance variables are automatically initialized with default values if not explicitly initialized.
   - Default values depend on the data type (e.g., 0 for numerical types, `null` for reference types, `false` for boolean).
   - Example:
     ```java
     public class Student {
         private int rollNumber; // Automatically initialized to 0
         private String name;    // Automatically initialized to null
         private boolean isActive; // Automatically initialized to false
     }
     ```

### 5. Multiple Instances:
   - Each instance of a class has its own set of instance variables.
   - Changes to instance variables in one object do not affect other objects of the same class.
   - Example:
     ```java
     Car car1 = new Car("Toyota", "Camry", 2022);
     Car car2 = new Car("Honda", "Accord", 2023);

     car1.make = "Ford"; // Only car1's make is changed
     ```

### 6. Encapsulation:
   - Instance variables can be encapsulated by declaring them as private and providing public getter and setter methods for controlled access.
   - This helps maintain data integrity and ensures proper state management.
   - Example:
     ```java
     public class Person {
         private String name;

         // Getter method
         public String getName() {
             return name;
         }

         // Setter method
         public void setName(String name) {
             this.name = name;
         }
     }
     ```

Instance variables are crucial components of Java classes, allowing objects to store and manage state. They provide the necessary flexibility for creating robust and modular software systems by encapsulating data within objects.

## constructors

In Java, constructors are special methods used for initializing objects. They have the same name as the class and are invoked automatically when an object of the class is created using the `new` keyword. Constructors do not have return types, not even `void`, and can be overloaded to provide different initialization options. Here's a detailed explanation of constructors in Java with examples:

### 1. Default Constructor:
   - If a class does not explicitly define any constructors, Java provides a default constructor.
   - The default constructor has no parameters and initializes instance variables with default values.
   - Example:
     ```java
     public class Car {
         // Default constructor
         public Car() {
             // Initialization code
         }
     }
     ```

### 2. Parameterized Constructor:
   - Parameterized constructors accept arguments to initialize instance variables with specific values.
   - They provide flexibility in object initialization by allowing clients to specify initial state during object creation.
   - Example:
     ```java
     public class Car {
         private String make;
         private String model;
         private int year;

         // Parameterized constructor
         public Car(String make, String model, int year) {
             this.make = make;
             this.model = model;
             this.year = year;
         }
     }
     ```

### 3. Overloading Constructors:
   - Java supports constructor overloading, allowing multiple constructors with different parameter lists within the same class.
   - This enables the creation of objects with different initialization options.
   - Example:
     ```java
     public class Person {
         private String name;
         private int age;

         // Parameterized constructor
         public Person(String name, int age) {
             this.name = name;
             this.age = age;
         }

         // Overloaded constructor without age parameter
         public Person(String name) {
             this.name = name;
             this.age = 0; // Default age
         }
     }
     ```

### 4. Chaining Constructors (Constructor Overloading with `this()`):
   - Constructors can call other constructors within the same class using `this()`.
   - This allows constructor chaining and reduces code duplication.
   - Example:
     ```java
     public class Rectangle {
         private int length;
         private int width;

         // Parameterized constructor
         public Rectangle(int length, int width) {
             this.length = length;
             this.width = width;
         }

         // Constructor chaining using this()
         public Rectangle(int side) {
             this(side, side); // Calls parameterized constructor
         }
     }
     ```

### 5. Initialization Blocks:
   - Initialization blocks are used for initializing instance variables.
   - They are executed before constructors when objects are created.
   - Example:
     ```java
     public class MyClass {
         private int value;

         // Initialization block
         {
             value = 10; // Initialize value
         }

         // Constructor
         public MyClass() {
             // Other initialization code
         }
     }
     ```

Constructors play a crucial role in object initialization and ensure that objects are in a valid state upon creation. They facilitate encapsulation by allowing classes to control how objects are initialized and provide a means for clients to customize object state. Proper use of constructors leads to cleaner, more maintainable code in Java programs.

## Object Class methods

The `Object` class in Java is the root of the class hierarchy and is automatically inherited by all other classes. It provides several methods that are available to all Java objects. Here are some of the most commonly used methods in the `Object` class:

1. **`toString()`:**
   - Returns a string representation of the object. By default, it returns the class name followed by the "@" symbol and the object's hash code.
   - It's common to override this method in your own classes to provide a more meaningful string representation.

2. **`equals(Object obj)`:**
   - Indicates whether some other object is "equal to" this one.
   - By default, it checks for reference equality (whether two references point to the same object in memory).
   - It's often overridden in classes to define custom equality based on the object's attributes.

3. **`hashCode()`:**
   - Returns a hash code value for the object.
   - By default, it returns a unique integer value based on the memory address of the object.
   - It's often overridden in classes that override the `equals()` method, ensuring that equal objects have equal hash codes.

4. **`getClass()`:**
   - Returns the runtime class of an object.
   - It's useful for getting information about the type of an object at runtime.

5. **`clone()`:**
   - Creates and returns a copy of this object.
   - It creates a shallow copy by default, but deep copying can be achieved by overriding this method.

6. **`finalize()`:**
   - Called by the garbage collector before the object is reclaimed.
   - It's rarely used because it's not guaranteed to be called promptly or at all.

7. **`notify()`, `notifyAll()`, `wait()`:**
   - These methods are used for inter-thread communication and synchronization. They're used in multi-threaded programming for managing threads and their execution.

These are the most commonly used methods in the `Object` class. It's important to understand them as they play a significant role in Java programming, especially when creating custom classes and dealing with object equality, string representation, and memory management.

## toString method
In Java, the `toString()` method is a part of the `Object` class and is used to return a string representation of an object. When you print an object directly, Java implicitly calls the `toString()` method to get a string representation of the object. The default implementation of `toString()` provided by the `Object` class returns a string that consists of the class name followed by the memory address of the object in hexadecimal format. However, you can override this method in your own classes to provide a custom string representation that suits your needs. Here's a detailed explanation of the `toString()` method in Java with examples:

### Default `toString()` Method:
If you don't override the `toString()` method in your class, the default implementation from the `Object` class will be used. It returns a string representation containing the class name and the memory address of the object.

Example:
```java
public class MyClass {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyClass obj = new MyClass();
        System.out.println(obj); // Output: MyClass@1f0036a
    }
}
```

### Overriding `toString()` Method:
To provide a meaningful string representation of an object, you can override the `toString()` method in your class. You can return any string that reflects the state of the object.

Example:
```java
public class Person {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    public Person(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Person{name='" + name + "', age=" + age + "}";
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Person person = new Person("Alice", 30);
        System.out.println(person); // Output: Person{name='Alice', age=30}
    }
}
```

### Use Cases:
1. **Debugging**: Overriding `toString()` makes debugging easier as it provides meaningful information about object state.
2. **Logging**: `toString()` can be used for logging purposes to print object details.
3. **Readable Output**: When working with collections or custom data structures, `toString()` can provide a readable output for debugging or logging.

### Best Practices:
1. **Include Relevant Information**: Return information that accurately represents the state of the object.
2. **Avoid Side Effects**: The `toString()` method should not modify the object's state.
3. **Be Concise**: Keep the output concise and informative.
4. **Handle Null Values**: Ensure that `toString()` handles null references gracefully to prevent NullPointerExceptions.

By overriding the `toString()` method, you can provide a customized string representation of your objects, making your code more readable and aiding in debugging and logging.

## Getter and Setters

In Java, getters and setters are methods used to access and modify the private fields (instance variables) of a class, respectively. They are commonly used to implement encapsulation, a fundamental principle of object-oriented programming. Encapsulation ensures that the internal state of an object is controlled and accessed through well-defined methods, providing better data security, flexibility, and maintainability. Here's a detailed explanation of getters and setters in Java, along with examples:

### 1. Getters:
- Getters are methods used to retrieve the value of a private field.
- They provide read-only access to the encapsulated data.
- Getters typically have the `get` prefix followed by the name of the field they access.
- Example:
  ```java
  public class Person {
      private String name;

      // Getter method for 'name' field
      public String getName() {
          return name;
      }
  }
  ```

### 2. Setters:
- Setters are methods used to modify the value of a private field.
- They provide write-only access to the encapsulated data.
- Setters typically have the `set` prefix followed by the name of the field they modify, and they take a parameter representing the new value.
- Example:
  ```java
  public class Person {
      private String name;

      // Setter method for 'name' field
      public void setName(String newName) {
          name = newName;
      }
  }
  ```

### Why Use Getters and Setters:
1. **Encapsulation**: Getters and setters enforce encapsulation by controlling access to the internal state of an object. They prevent direct access to the fields, allowing for better data integrity and security.

2. **Flexibility**: Getters and setters provide flexibility to change the internal implementation of a class without affecting the external code that uses it. For example, you can add validation logic or perform calculations when getting or setting a value.

3. **Data Validation**: Setters allow you to validate input before setting the value of a field. This ensures that only valid data is stored in the object.

4. **Readability and Maintainability**: By providing descriptive method names (`get` and `set`), code becomes more readable and self-explanatory. This improves maintainability and reduces the likelihood of errors when working with the class.

### Example:
Here's an example demonstrating the use of getters and setters in a `Person` class:

```java
public class Person {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    // Getter for 'name' field
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    // Setter for 'name' field
    public void setName(String newName) {
        name = newName;
    }

    // Getter for 'age' field
    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }

    // Setter for 'age' field
    public void setAge(int newAge) {
        if (newAge >= 0 && newAge <= 120) { // Age validation
            age = newAge;
        } else {
            System.out.println("Invalid age!");
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Person` class encapsulates the `name` and `age` fields using getters and setters. The setters include validation logic to ensure that the age is within a valid range (0 to 120). This demonstrates how getters and setters can enhance data security and integrity while providing flexibility and maintainability in Java programs.

## this Keyword
The `this` keyword in Java is a reference variable that refers to the current object within a method or constructor. It's primarily used to differentiate between instance variables and parameters with the same name, as well as to access instance methods and constructors from within the same class. Here's a detailed explanation of the `this` keyword with examples:

### 1. Reference to Current Object:
   - Inside any method or constructor, `this` refers to the current object.
   - It can be used to access instance variables and methods of the current object.
   - Example:
     ```java
     public class Person {
         private String name;

         public Person(String name) {
             // Using 'this' to refer to instance variable
             this.name = name;
         }

         public void sayHello() {
             // Using 'this' to refer to instance method
             System.out.println("Hello, my name is " + this.name);
         }
     }
     ```

### 2. Differentiating Between Instance Variables and Parameters:
   - When instance variables have the same name as parameters or local variables, `this` can be used to refer to the instance variables.
   - Example:
     ```java
     public class Rectangle {
         private int length;
         private int width;

         public Rectangle(int length, int width) {
             // 'this.length' and 'this.width' refer to instance variables
             this.length = length;
             this.width = width;
         }
     }
     ```

### 3. Passing Current Object as Argument:
   - `this` can be used to pass the current object as an argument to other methods.
   - Example:
     ```java
     public class Calculator {
         private int result;

         public Calculator() {
             this.result = 0;
         }

         public void add(int num) {
             this.result += num;
         }

         public void displayResult() {
             // Passing current object as argument to printResult method
             printResult(this);
         }

         private void printResult(Calculator calc) {
             System.out.println("Result: " + calc.result);
         }
     }
     ```

### 4. Chaining Constructors (Constructor Overloading):
   - `this` can be used to call one constructor from another constructor in the same class.
   - This allows constructor chaining and helps avoid code duplication.
   - Example:
     ```java
     public class Car {
         private String make;
         private String model;

         public Car() {
             this("Toyota", "Camry"); // Calling parameterized constructor
         }

         public Car(String make, String model) {
             this.make = make;
             this.model = model;
         }
     }
     ```

### 5. Returning Current Object:
   - `this` can be used to return the current object from a method, allowing method chaining.
   - Example:
     ```java
     public class Person {
         private String name;

         public Person setName(String name) {
             this.name = name;
             return this; // Returning current object
         }

         public void displayInfo() {
             System.out.println("Name: " + this.name);
         }
     }
     ```

The `this` keyword is a powerful tool in Java that helps maintain clarity in code, enables effective use of instance variables and methods, and facilitates constructor chaining and method chaining. Understanding and correctly using `this` is essential for writing clean and efficient Java code.

## wrapper classes

Wrapper classes in Java are classes that encapsulate primitive data types within objects. They provide a way to represent primitive data types as objects, allowing them to be used in situations where objects are required. Wrapper classes also provide utility methods for converting between primitive data types and performing various operations on them. Here's a detailed explanation of wrapper classes in Java with examples:

### Why Use Wrapper Classes?

1. **Objects Required**: Some Java APIs and libraries require objects instead of primitive data types. Wrapper classes allow primitive types to be used in such scenarios.

2. **Generics**: Generics in Java do not support primitive data types. Wrapper classes enable the use of primitive types as generic type parameters.

3. **Nullability**: Wrapper classes can represent null values, while primitive types cannot. This is useful when dealing with data that may or may not have a value.

4. **Collections and Data Structures**: Many Java collections and data structures, such as ArrayList and HashMap, work with objects rather than primitives. Wrapper classes facilitate the use of primitive data types in these structures.

### Commonly Used Wrapper Classes:

1. **`Integer`**: Wraps an `int` value.
2. **`Long`**: Wraps a `long` value.
3. **`Double`**: Wraps a `double` value.
4. **`Float`**: Wraps a `float` value.
5. **`Boolean`**: Wraps a `boolean` value.
6. **`Character`**: Wraps a `char` value.
7. **`Byte`**: Wraps a `byte` value.
8. **`Short`**: Wraps a `short` value.

### Examples:

#### 1. Using Wrapper Classes with Collections:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // ArrayList of Integer objects
        ArrayList<Integer> numbers = new ArrayList<>();
        numbers.add(10);
        numbers.add(20);
        numbers.add(30);

        // Accessing element using wrapper class methods
        int firstNumber = numbers.get(0);
        System.out.println("First number: " + firstNumber);
    }
}
```

#### 2. Converting Between Wrapper Classes and Primitive Types:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Wrapper to primitive
        Integer wrappedInt = Integer.valueOf(10);
        int primitiveInt = wrappedInt.intValue();
        System.out.println("Primitive int: " + primitiveInt);

        // Primitive to wrapper
        int anotherInt = 20;
        Integer anotherWrappedInt = Integer.valueOf(anotherInt);
        System.out.println("Another wrapped int: " + anotherWrappedInt);
    }
}
```

#### 3. Nullability:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Integer nullableInt = null; // Wrapper class can represent null
        System.out.println("Nullable integer: " + nullableInt);

        int primitiveInt = nullableInt; // This will result in a NullPointerException
    }
}
```

Wrapper classes provide flexibility and functionality beyond what primitive data types offer, making them essential in Java programming when dealing with objects, generics, collections, and situations requiring nullability.

## Modifiers
In Java, modifiers are keywords that can be applied to classes, methods, variables, and other elements to specify their behavior, visibility, and accessibility. They control various aspects of how these elements can be accessed and used within a Java program. Here's a detailed explanation of modifiers in Java with examples:

### 1. Access Modifiers:

Access modifiers control the accessibility of classes, methods, and variables from other classes or packages.

1. **`public`**:
   - Allows unrestricted access to the class, method, or variable from any other class or package.
   - Example:
     ```java
     public class MyClass {
         public void myMethod() {
             // Method accessible from any class or package
         }
     }
     ```

2. **`protected`**:
   - Allows access to the class, method, or variable within the same package or by subclasses, regardless of the package.
   - Example:
     ```java
     protected class MyBaseClass {
         protected void myMethod() {
             // Method accessible within the same package or by subclasses
         }
     }
     ```

3. **`default` (no modifier)**:
   - Also known as package-private.
   - Allows access to the class, method, or variable within the same package but not from outside the package.
   - Example:
     ```java
     class MyPackageClass {
         void myMethod() {
             // Method accessible only within the same package
         }
     }
     ```

4. **`private`**:
   - Restricts access to the class, method, or variable within the same class only.
   - Example:
     ```java
     public class MyClass {
         private int myVariable;
         private void myMethod() {
             // Method accessible only within the same class
         }
     }
     ```

### 2. Non-Access Modifiers:

Non-access modifiers provide additional functionality and behavior to classes, methods, and variables.

1. **`final`**:
   - Indicates that a variable, method, or class cannot be modified or extended, respectively.
   - Example:
     ```java
     public class MyClass {
         final int myVariable = 10; // Final variable cannot be reassigned
         final void myMethod() {
             // Final method cannot be overridden
         }
     }
     ```

2. **`static`**:
   - Indicates that a method or variable belongs to the class rather than to instances of the class. Only one instance of the variable exists for the class.
   - Example:
     ```java
     public class MyClass {
         static int count = 0; // Static variable shared among all instances of MyClass
         static void incrementCount() {
             count++; // Static method can access static variables directly
         }
     }
     ```

3. **`abstract`**:
   - Indicates that a class or method does not have a complete implementation and must be implemented by subclasses (for abstract classes) or overridden by subclasses (for abstract methods).
   - Example:
     ```java
     public abstract class Shape {
         abstract void draw(); // Abstract method must be implemented by subclasses
     }
     ```

4. **`synchronized`**:
   - Applies to methods or code blocks to ensure that only one thread can access them at a time, preventing concurrent access and potential race conditions.
   - Example:
     ```java
     public synchronized void myMethod() {
         // Method body synchronized to prevent concurrent access
     }
     ```

5. **`volatile`**:
   - Indicates that a variable's value may be modified by different threads and ensures that changes to the variable are immediately visible to other threads.
   - Example:
     ```java
     public volatile int myVariable;
     ```

6. **`transient`**:
   - Indicates that a variable should not be serialized when the object containing it is serialized.
   - Example:
     ```java
     public transient int sensitiveData;
     ```

7. **`native`**:
   - Indicates that a method is implemented in native code (code written in another programming language such as C or C++) and should be linked at runtime.
   - Example:
     ```java
     public native void nativeMethod();
     ```

8. **`strictfp`**:
   - Applies to classes or methods and ensures that floating-point calculations are performed in a consistent manner across different platforms.
   - Example:
     ```java
     public strictfp class MyClass {
         strictfp void myMethod() {
             // Floating-point calculations performed in a consistent manner
         }
     }
     ```

Modifiers in Java provide a powerful mechanism for controlling access, behavior, and functionality of classes, methods, and variables, enabling developers to design robust and secure Java applications.

## static keyword

In Java, the `static` keyword is used to declare members (variables, methods, and nested classes) that belong to the class itself, rather than to instances of the class. This means that only one instance of a `static` member exists, regardless of how many instances of the class are created. Here's a detailed explanation of `static` in Java with examples:

### 1. Static Variables:

Static variables, also known as class variables, are shared among all instances of a class. They are declared with the `static` keyword.

Example:
```java
public class MyClass {
    public static int count = 0; // Static variable

    public MyClass() {
        count++; // Incrementing static variable in the constructor
    }
}
```

### 2. Static Methods:

Static methods belong to the class rather than to instances of the class. They can be called directly using the class name, without the need to create an instance of the class.

Example:
```java
public class MathUtils {
    public static int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b; // Static method to add two numbers
    }
}

// Calling static method without creating an instance
int sum = MathUtils.add(5, 3);
```

### 3. Static Blocks:

Static blocks are used for static initialization of a class. They execute when the class is loaded into memory and are executed only once, before the execution of the main method or creation of any object.

Example:
```java
public class MyClass {
    static {
        System.out.println("Static block executed"); // Static block
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Main method
    }
}
```

### 4. Static Nested Classes:

Static nested classes are nested classes that are declared as `static`. They do not have access to the instance variables and methods of the outer class unless they are also declared as `static`.

Example:
```java
public class OuterClass {
    static class NestedClass {
        void display() {
            System.out.println("Nested class method");
        }
    }
}

// Creating an instance of the static nested class
OuterClass.NestedClass nestedObj = new OuterClass.NestedClass();
nestedObj.display();
```

### 5. Static Import:

Static imports allow static members (variables and methods) of another class to be imported directly into the current class, eliminating the need to qualify their names with the class name.

Example:
```java
import static java.lang.Math.PI;
import static java.lang.Math.sqrt;

public class Circle {
    public static double calculateArea(double radius) {
        return PI * sqrt(radius); // Using static imports
    }
}
```

### Best Practices:

1. Use `static` for methods that do not depend on instance variables.
2. Avoid using `static` for mutable state that needs to be shared across instances.
3. Use `static` blocks for static initialization and loading resources.
4. Prefer using `ClassName.methodName()` over `objectName.methodName()` for static methods.

`static` in Java provides a way to define class-level behavior and state, allowing for better organization of code and improved performance in certain scenarios. However, overuse of static members can lead to tightly coupled and less maintainable code, so it should be used judiciously.

## overloaded methods
Method overloading in Java allows you to define multiple methods in the same class with the same name but different parameter lists. This enables you to create methods that perform similar tasks but with different types or numbers of parameters. Here's a detailed explanation of method overloading in Java with examples:

### 1. Method Signature:
   - Method overloading is based on the method signature, which includes the method name and the parameter list (number, type, and order of parameters).
   - Methods with the same name but different parameter lists are considered overloaded.

### 2. Example of Method Overloading:
```java
public class Calculator {
    // Method to add two integers
    public int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    // Method to add three integers
    public int add(int a, int b, int c) {
        return a + b + c;
    }

    // Method to add two doubles
    public double add(double a, double b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}
```

In the above example, the `add()` method is overloaded three times:
- The first `add()` method takes two integers as parameters.
- The second `add()` method takes three integers as parameters.
- The third `add()` method takes two doubles as parameters.

### 3. Overloading Rules:
   - Methods can be overloaded within the same class.
   - Overloaded methods must have a different number of parameters, different types of parameters, or both.
   - Return type alone is not sufficient to distinguish overloaded methods.
   - Overloaded methods can have different access modifiers.

### 4. Example Demonstrating Overloading Rules:
```java
public class Example {
    // Overloaded methods based on parameter type
    public void display(int num) {
        System.out.println("Displaying integer: " + num);
    }

    public void display(double num) {
        System.out.println("Displaying double: " + num);
    }

    // Overloaded methods based on parameter order
    public void print(String message, int count) {
        System.out.println("Printing message: " + message + ", count: " + count);
    }

    public void print(int count, String message) {
        System.out.println("Printing count: " + count + ", message: " + message);
    }
}
```

### 5. Overloading with Varargs:
   - Java allows method overloading with variable-length argument lists (varargs).
   - Varargs must be the last parameter in the method signature.
   - Example:
```java
public class Example {
    // Overloaded method with varargs
    public void display(int... nums) {
        for (int num : nums) {
            System.out.println("Displaying integer: " + num);
        }
    }
}
```

### 6. Overloading and Inheritance:
   - Overloaded methods are resolved at compile time, based on the reference type.
   - Overloaded methods are not inherited by subclasses.

Method overloading provides flexibility and clarity in method design, allowing you to create methods with the same name but different behaviors based on the parameters they accept. It promotes code reusability and enhances readability by providing a consistent interface for similar operations with different inputs.

## method overriding

Method overriding in Java allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. When a method in a subclass has the same signature (method name, number and type of parameters, and return type) as a method in its superclass, it is said to override the superclass method. This allows for polymorphic behavior, where the subclass method is invoked at runtime based on the actual object type. Here's a detailed explanation of method overriding in Java with examples:

### 1. Basic Example:
```java
class Animal {
    public void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    public void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal animal = new Dog();
        animal.sound(); // Output: Dog barks
    }
}
```
In this example, the `sound()` method in the `Dog` class overrides the `sound()` method in the `Animal` class.

### 2. Access Modifier:
```java
class Animal {
    protected void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    // Overriding method can have a less restrictive access modifier
    @Override
    public void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}
```
Here, the `sound()` method in the `Animal` class is declared as `protected`, and the overriding `sound()` method in the `Dog` class is declared as `public`, which is less restrictive.

### 3. Return Type:
```java
class Animal {
    public void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    // Covariant return type: Overriding method can have a subtype return type
    @Override
    public String sound() {
        return "Dog barks";
    }
}
```
In this example, the `sound()` method in the `Dog` class overrides the `sound()` method in the `Animal` class and returns a `String`, which is a subtype of `Object`.

### 4. Exception Handling:
```java
import java.io.IOException;

class Animal {
    // Superclass method throws an IOException
    public void sound() throws IOException {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    // Overriding method throws a more specific exception
    @Override
    public void sound() throws IllegalArgumentException {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}
```
In this example, the overriding `sound()` method in the `Dog` class throws a more specific exception (`IllegalArgumentException`) than the `IOException` thrown by the superclass method.

### 5. Static and Private Methods:
```java
class Animal {
    public static void staticMethod() {
        System.out.println("Animal static method");
    }

    private void privateMethod() {
        System.out.println("Animal private method");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    // Static methods cannot be overridden; this is method hiding
    public static void staticMethod() {
        System.out.println("Dog static method");
    }

    // Private methods cannot be overridden
    private void privateMethod() {
        System.out.println("Dog private method");
    }
}
```
In Java, static and private methods cannot be overridden, but they can be redefined in subclasses, which is called method hiding. Therefore, the `staticMethod()` and `privateMethod()` in the `Dog` class are not overrides but redefinitions.

Method overriding is a key concept in Java's polymorphism mechanism, allowing subclasses to provide specific implementations of methods inherited from superclasses. It enables code reuse, flexibility, and extensibility in object-oriented programming.

## Override vs. overload
In Java, both overloading and overriding are important concepts in object-oriented programming, but they serve different purposes and apply to different elements of a class hierarchy. Here's a detailed comparison between overloading and overriding, along with examples for each:

### Overloading:

1. **Definition**:
   - Overloading occurs when multiple methods in the same class have the same name but different parameters (number, type, or order).

2. **Scope**:
   - Overloading happens within the same class.

3. **Return Type**:
   - Overloading can have the same or different return types.

4. **Example**:
   ```java
   public class Calculator {
       public int add(int a, int b) {
           return a + b;
       }

       // Overloaded method with different parameter types
       public double add(double a, double b) {
           return a + b;
       }
   }
   ```

5. **Invocation**:
   - The method to be invoked is determined at compile-time based on the method signature.

6. **Polymorphism**:
   - Overloading is an example of compile-time polymorphism (also known as static or early binding), where the method to be executed is determined by the compiler.

### Override:

1. **Definition**:
   - Overriding occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.

2. **Scope**:
   - Overriding occurs between a superclass and its subclass.

3. **Return Type**:
   - Overriding must have the same return type or a covariant return type (a subtype of the return type in the superclass).

4. **Example**:
   ```java
   class Animal {
       public void sound() {
           System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
       }
   }

   class Dog extends Animal {
       @Override
       public void sound() {
           System.out.println("Dog barks");
       }
   }
   ```

5. **Invocation**:
   - The method to be invoked is determined at runtime based on the actual object type (dynamic dispatch).

6. **Polymorphism**:
   - Overriding is an example of runtime polymorphism (also known as dynamic or late binding), where the method to be executed is determined during runtime based on the actual type of the object.

### Key Differences:

- Overloading involves multiple methods with the same name but different parameters within the same class, while overriding involves a subclass providing a specific implementation of a method defined in its superclass.
- Overloading is resolved at compile-time based on the method signature, while overriding is resolved at runtime based on the actual object type.
- Overloading allows methods with different behaviors to have the same name, providing convenience and flexibility in method invocation, while overriding allows subclasses to provide specialized behavior for inherited methods, enabling polymorphic behavior.

Understanding the differences between overloading and overriding is essential for designing and implementing robust and flexible Java applications.

## super keyword

In Java, the `super` keyword is a reference variable that is used to refer to the superclass (parent class) of the current object instance. It can be used to access superclass members, constructors, and methods, as well as to invoke superclass constructors. Here's a detailed explanation of the `super` keyword in Java with examples:

### 1. Accessing Superclass Members:

```java
class Animal {
    String type = "Animal";

    void display() {
        System.out.println("Type: " + type);
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    String type = "Dog";

    void display() {
        // Accessing superclass member using 'super'
        super.display();
        System.out.println("Type: " + type);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog dog = new Dog();
        dog.display();
    }
}
```

Output:
```
Type: Animal
Type: Dog
```

In this example, the `Dog` class overrides the `display()` method from its superclass `Animal`. Inside the `display()` method of `Dog`, `super.display()` is used to call the superclass `display()` method before printing the `Dog` type.

### 2. Invoking Superclass Constructor:

```java
class Animal {
    String type;

    Animal(String type) {
        this.type = type;
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    String name;

    Dog(String type, String name) {
        // Invoking superclass constructor using 'super'
        super(type);
        this.name = name;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog dog = new Dog("Canine", "Buddy");
        System.out.println("Type: " + dog.type);
        System.out.println("Name: " + dog.name);
    }
}
```

Output:
```
Type: Canine
Name: Buddy
```

In this example, the `Dog` class invokes the constructor of its superclass `Animal` using `super(type)` to initialize the `type` attribute inherited from `Animal`.

### 3. Accessing Superclass Methods:

```java
class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void sound() {
        super.sound(); // Calling superclass method using 'super'
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog dog = new Dog();
        dog.sound();
    }
}
```

Output:
```
Animal makes a sound
Dog barks
```

In this example, the `Dog` class overrides the `sound()` method from its superclass `Animal`. Inside the overridden `sound()` method, `super.sound()` is used to call the superclass `sound()` method before printing "Dog barks".

### 4. Accessing Superclass Variables:

```java
class Animal {
    String type = "Animal";
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    String type = "Dog";

    void display() {
        System.out.println("Superclass type: " + super.type); // Accessing superclass variable using 'super'
        System.out.println("Subclass type: " + type);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog dog = new Dog();
        dog.display();
    }
}
```

Output:
```
Superclass type: Animal
Subclass type: Dog
```

In this example, the `Dog` class has a variable `type` which hides the `type` variable from its superclass `Animal`. Inside the `display()` method, `super.type` is used to access the `type` variable from the superclass.

The `super` keyword in Java is a powerful tool for working with inheritance, allowing subclasses to access and utilize members and behavior from their superclass. It enables better code organization, flexibility, and maintainability in object-oriented programming.

## inharitance
Inheritance is one of the fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP), including Java. It allows a class (subclass) to inherit properties and behavior from another class (superclass). This promotes code reuse, abstraction, and hierarchical organization of classes. Here's a detailed explanation of inheritance in Java with examples:

### 1. Basic Inheritance:

```java
// Superclass
class Animal {
    String type;

    Animal(String type) {
        this.type = type;
    }

    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

// Subclass inheriting from Animal
class Dog extends Animal {
    String name;

    Dog(String type, String name) {
        // Call superclass constructor using 'super'
        super(type);
        this.name = name;
    }

    void bark() {
        System.out.println(name + " barks");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog dog = new Dog("Canine", "Buddy");
        dog.sound(); // Inherited method
        dog.bark();  // Subclass method
    }
}
```

Output:
```
Animal makes a sound
Buddy barks
```

In this example, `Dog` is a subclass of `Animal`. It inherits the `type` attribute and `sound()` method from `Animal`, and also adds its own `name` attribute and `bark()` method.

### 2. Method Overriding:

```java
class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    // Override superclass method
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog dog = new Dog();
        dog.sound(); // Output: Dog barks
    }
}
```

In this example, the `sound()` method in the `Dog` class overrides the `sound()` method in its superclass `Animal`. This allows `Dog` objects to have their own implementation of the `sound()` method.

### 3. Access Modifiers in Inheritance:

```java
class Animal {
    private String type;

    Animal(String type) {
        this.type = type;
    }

    // Accessor method
    public String getType() {
        return type;
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    Dog(String type) {
        // Call superclass constructor using 'super'
        super(type);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog dog = new Dog("Canine");
        System.out.println(dog.getType()); // Output: Canine
    }
}
```

In this example, the `type` attribute in the `Animal` class is `private`, but it's accessible in the `Dog` class through inheritance. The `getType()` method is used to access the `type` attribute of the `Animal` class from a `Dog` object.

### 4. Multilevel Inheritance:

```java
class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

class GermanShepherd extends Dog {
    void guard() {
        System.out.println("German Shepherd guards");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        GermanShepherd dog = new GermanShepherd();
        dog.sound();  // Output: Animal makes a sound
        dog.bark();   // Output: Dog barks
        dog.guard();  // Output: German Shepherd guards
    }
}
```

In this example, `GermanShepherd` is a subclass of `Dog`, which is itself a subclass of `Animal`. `GermanShepherd` inherits properties and behavior from both `Dog` and `Animal`.

Inheritance is a powerful mechanism in Java for creating a hierarchical structure of classes, promoting code reuse, and facilitating polymorphic behavior. It allows for the creation of complex systems with clear relationships between classes. However, it's important to use inheritance judiciously to avoid excessive coupling and maintainability issues.

## abstraction

Abstract classes in Java are classes that cannot be instantiated directly but serve as blueprints for other classes. They can contain abstract methods, which are methods without a body, as well as concrete methods with implementations. Abstract classes are used to define common behavior and enforce a contract on subclasses. Here's a detailed explanation of abstract classes in Java with examples:

### 1. Basic Abstract Class:

```java
abstract class Animal {
    String type;

    Animal(String type) {
        this.type = type;
    }

    // Abstract method
    abstract void sound();

    // Concrete method
    void displayType() {
        System.out.println("Type: " + type);
    }
}
```

In this example, `Animal` is an abstract class with an abstract method `sound()` and a concrete method `displayType()`. Abstract methods are declared using the `abstract` keyword and do not have a method body.

### 2. Subclassing an Abstract Class:

```java
class Dog extends Animal {
    String name;

    Dog(String type, String name) {
        super(type);
        this.name = name;
    }

    // Implementing abstract method
    @Override
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}
```

Here, `Dog` is a concrete subclass of the abstract class `Animal`. It provides an implementation for the abstract method `sound()`.

### 3. Instantiation of Subclasses:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog dog = new Dog("Canine", "Buddy");
        dog.displayType(); // Output: Type: Canine
        dog.sound();      // Output: Dog barks
    }
}
```

In the `Main` class, we create an instance of the `Dog` class. Since `Dog` extends `Animal`, it inherits the `displayType()` method. We can also invoke the `sound()` method, which is implemented in the `Dog` class.

### 4. Abstract Methods:

Abstract methods must be implemented by concrete subclasses. If a subclass fails to provide an implementation for an abstract method, it must be declared as abstract itself.

### 5. Abstract Classes vs. Interfaces:

Abstract classes can have constructors, member variables, and non-abstract methods, whereas interfaces cannot. However, Java supports multiple interface inheritance but not multiple class inheritance.

### 6. Example with Multiple Subclasses:

```java
abstract class Shape {
    abstract double area();
}

class Circle extends Shape {
    double radius;

    Circle(double radius) {
        this.radius = radius;
    }

    @Override
    double area() {
        return Math.PI * radius * radius;
    }
}

class Rectangle extends Shape {
    double length;
    double width;

    Rectangle(double length, double width) {
        this.length = length;
        this.width = width;
    }

    @Override
    double area() {
        return length * width;
    }
}
```

In this example, `Shape` is an abstract class with an abstract method `area()`. `Circle` and `Rectangle` are concrete subclasses that provide implementations for the `area()` method.

Abstract classes are useful when you want to define common behavior for a group of related classes while leaving specific implementations to the subclasses. They provide a way to enforce consistency and structure in object-oriented designs.

## encapsulation
Encapsulation is one of the four fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) in Java, alongside inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. It refers to the bundling of data and methods that operate on that data into a single unit, often referred to as a class. The data within the class is typically hidden from external access, and access to it is controlled through public methods. Encapsulation helps in achieving data hiding, abstraction, and modularity, ultimately leading to more robust and maintainable code. Here's a detailed explanation of encapsulation in Java with examples:

### 1. Data Hiding:

Encapsulation allows you to hide the internal state of an object and only expose the necessary functionalities through methods. This prevents direct access to the object's data from external classes, ensuring that it remains consistent and valid.

```java
public class Car {
    private String make;
    private String model;
    private int year;

    // Getter methods
    public String getMake() {
        return make;
    }

    public String getModel() {
        return model;
    }

    public int getYear() {
        return year;
    }

    // Setter methods
    public void setMake(String make) {
        this.make = make;
    }

    public void setModel(String model) {
        this.model = model;
    }

    public void setYear(int year) {
        if (year > 0) {
            this.year = year;
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, the `make`, `model`, and `year` variables are declared as private, making them inaccessible from outside the `Car` class. Public getter and setter methods provide controlled access to these variables.

### 2. Abstraction:

Encapsulation also enables abstraction by hiding the internal implementation details of an object and exposing only the essential features. Clients interacting with the object do not need to know how it internally manages its data.

```java
public class BankAccount {
    private double balance;

    public void deposit(double amount) {
        // Internal implementation details omitted
        balance += amount;
    }

    public void withdraw(double amount) {
        // Internal implementation details omitted
        balance -= amount;
    }

    public double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }
}
```

In this example, the `BankAccount` class abstracts away the details of how deposits and withdrawals are processed internally. Clients only need to interact with public methods like `deposit()`, `withdraw()`, and `getBalance()`.

### 3. Modularity and Flexibility:

Encapsulation promotes modularity by encapsulating related data and behavior within a single unit (class). This makes the code easier to understand, maintain, and reuse. It also allows for changes to the internal implementation without affecting the external interface.

```java
public class Employee {
    private String name;
    private double salary;

    public Employee(String name, double salary) {
        this.name = name;
        this.salary = salary;
    }

    public void raiseSalary(double percentage) {
        salary += (salary * percentage) / 100;
    }

    // Other methods for employee management
}
```

In this example, the `Employee` class encapsulates employee data (name, salary) and behavior (raising salary) within a single unit, making it easier to manage and modify employee-related functionalities.

### 4. Access Control:

Encapsulation allows you to enforce access control by defining which parts of the class are visible and accessible from outside. This helps in maintaining the integrity and security of the object's data.

```java
public class Student {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    // Private method accessible only within the class
    private boolean isAdult() {
        return age >= 18;
    }

    // Public method to access isAdult() indirectly
    public String getAdultStatus() {
        return isAdult() ? "Adult" : "Minor";
    }
}
```

In this example, the `isAdult()` method is declared as private, making it accessible only within the `Student` class. Clients can indirectly access its functionality through the public `getAdultStatus()` method.

Encapsulation is a fundamental principle in Java programming that promotes information hiding, abstraction, modularity, and access control. It helps in building robust, maintainable, and secure software systems.

## interface

In Java, an interface is a reference type that specifies a set of methods that a class implementing the interface must implement. It acts as a contract, defining the behavior that implementing classes must adhere to, without providing any implementation details itself. Interfaces facilitate multiple inheritance, allowing a class to implement multiple interfaces. Here's a detailed explanation of the `interface` keyword in Java with examples:

### 1. Basic Interface:

```java
public interface Animal {
    void sound(); // Abstract method declaration
}
```

In this example, `Animal` is an interface that declares a single abstract method `sound()`. Any class that implements the `Animal` interface must provide an implementation for the `sound()` method.

### 2. Implementing an Interface:

```java
public class Dog implements Animal {
    @Override
    public void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}
```

Here, `Dog` implements the `Animal` interface and provides an implementation for the `sound()` method as required by the interface contract.

### 3. Extending Multiple Interfaces:

```java
public interface Mammal {
    void eat(); // Abstract method declaration
}

public class Dog implements Animal, Mammal {
    @Override
    public void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }

    @Override
    public void eat() {
        System.out.println("Dog eats");
    }
}
```

In this example, `Dog` implements both the `Animal` and `Mammal` interfaces, providing implementations for the abstract methods declared in each interface.

### 4. Default and Static Methods:

Starting from Java 8, interfaces can also contain default and static methods, providing default implementations for methods and allowing static methods within interfaces.

```java
public interface Vehicle {
    void start();

    default void stop() {
        System.out.println("Vehicle stops");
    }

    static void info() {
        System.out.println("This is a Vehicle interface");
    }
}
```

Here, `Vehicle` interface contains a default method `stop()` and a static method `info()`, which can be called directly from the interface itself.

### 5. Using Interfaces in Client Code:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog dog = new Dog();
        dog.sound(); // Output: Dog barks
        dog.eat();   // Output: Dog eats
        dog.stop();  // Output: Vehicle stops

        Vehicle.info(); // Output: This is a Vehicle interface
    }
}
```

In this example, we create an instance of `Dog` and call its methods. Additionally, we call the static method `info()` from the `Vehicle` interface directly without creating an instance of a class.

### 6. Interface Inheritance:

Interfaces can extend other interfaces, inheriting their abstract methods. A class implementing a sub-interface must provide implementations for all inherited abstract methods.

```java
public interface Pet extends Animal {
    void play();
}
```

Here, `Pet` interface extends the `Animal` interface, inheriting the `sound()` method. Any class implementing the `Pet` interface must provide implementations for both `sound()` and `play()` methods.

Interfaces play a crucial role in Java programming, providing a mechanism for achieving abstraction, multiple inheritance, and defining contracts for classes to adhere to. They enable better code organization, maintainability, and flexibility in Java applications.
