# Angular.js

AngularJS (commonly referred to as Angular 1.x) is a JavaScript-based open-source front-end web application framework. It was initially developed by Google and released in 2010. AngularJS is designed to simplify the development of dynamic web applications by providing a structured framework for building single-page applications (SPAs).

Key features and concepts of AngularJS include:

* Two-way data binding: AngularJS provides automatic synchronization of data between the model (data) and the view (UI), eliminating the need for manual DOM manipulation.

* Directives: Directives are markers on DOM elements that add behavior to the HTML. AngularJS comes with a set of built-in directives and allows developers to create custom directives.

* MV* Architecture: AngularJS follows the Model-View-Whatever (MV*) architecture pattern, where the model represents the application's data, the view represents the UI, and the whatever (controllers, services, filters, etc.) manages the logic and behavior.

* Dependency Injection: AngularJS has a built-in dependency injection system that helps manage dependencies between components and promotes code reusability and testability.

* Templating: AngularJS uses HTML as the template language, allowing developers to extend HTML with AngularJS-specific elements and attributes.

* Testing: AngularJS provides a testing framework called Karma, which integrates with other testing libraries like Jasmine and allows for easy unit testing of AngularJS applications.

It's important to note that AngularJS (1.x) is distinct from Angular (2+), which is a complete rewrite of the framework and introduces significant changes in terms of syntax, architecture, and concepts.

AngularJS has gained popularity for its simplicity, declarative programming style, and ability to handle complex UI interactions. However, as Angular (2+) offers a more modern and powerful framework, developers are encouraged to migrate from AngularJS to the latest version of Angular for new projects.



## Versions of Angular.js

AngularJS (Angular 1.x) has several versions that were released over time. The major versions of AngularJS are:

* AngularJS 1.0: The initial release of AngularJS in 2010.
* AngularJS 1.1: Introduced improvements and new features over the 1.0 version.
* AngularJS 1.2: Released in November 2013 with significant updates and improvements.
* AngularJS 1.3: Released in October 2014, focusing on performance enhancements and bug fixes.
* AngularJS 1.4: Released in May 2015, providing new features and improved stability.
* AngularJS 1.5: Released in February 2016, introducing new components and enhancements.
* AngularJS 1.6: Released in December 2016, with improvements and bug fixes.
* AngularJS 1.7: Released in May 2018, featuring stability improvements and bug fixes.

It's worth noting that AngularJS 1.7 is the last official release of AngularJS (Angular 1.x). After that, the Angular team shifted their focus to Angular (Angular 2+) and AngularJS entered a Long Term Support (LTS) phase. The LTS phase ensures that critical bug fixes and security updates are provided, but no major new features are introduced.

Since AngularJS 1.x is an older version of Angular, it is recommended to use the latest version of Angular (Angular 2+) for new projects, as it offers better performance, enhanced features, and improved developer experience.


## Angular 2+

Angular 2 is a complete rewrite of the original AngularJS framework, introducing significant changes and improvements. It was released in September 2016 by Google and is a part of the Angular framework family. Angular 2, along with subsequent versions like Angular 4, Angular 5, and so on, is often referred to as simply "Angular."

Key features and improvements in Angular 2 include:

* Component-based architecture: Angular 2 introduces a component-based architecture where applications are built by composing reusable components. Components are the building blocks of Angular applications and encapsulate the logic, data, and UI.

* Improved performance: Angular 2 is designed to be faster and more efficient compared to AngularJS. It achieves this through various optimizations, such as change detection and ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation.

* Reactive programming: Angular 2 embraces reactive programming concepts with the introduction of RxJS (Reactive Extensions for JavaScript). RxJS allows developers to handle asynchronous operations, event streams, and data manipulation in a reactive and declarative manner.

* Enhanced template syntax: Angular 2 uses an enhanced template syntax that combines HTML with additional directives and features. The template syntax provides a more powerful and expressive way to define views and handle data binding.

* TypeScript language: Angular 2 is built with TypeScript, a statically-typed superset of JavaScript. TypeScript adds features like static typing, classes, interfaces, and modules, enabling better tooling, code organization, and maintainability.

* Improved dependency injection: Angular 2 features a refined and more efficient dependency injection system, making it easier to manage dependencies between components and services.

* Mobile and cross-platform development: Angular 2 supports building mobile and cross-platform applications with tools like NativeScript and Ionic. These frameworks allow developers to create native mobile apps using Angular and JavaScript/TypeScript.

Angular 2 and its subsequent versions introduced a more modern and robust framework compared to AngularJS (Angular 1.x). The Angular ecosystem continues to evolve with regular updates and improvements, providing developers with a powerful platform for building web and mobile applications.
