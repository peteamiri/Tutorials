Below is a table listing some commonly used flags (options) in Nmap along with brief descriptions of their functionalities:

| Flag (Option)   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| -sS             | TCP SYN scan: Sends SYN packets to the target ports and analyzes responses to determine if they are open, closed, or filtered. This is one of the most common scan types and is also known as half-open scanning.                                                                                   |
| -sT             | TCP Connect scan: Actively opens TCP connections to the target ports and examines responses to determine their state. This scan is slower and more detectable compared to SYN scanning, as it completes the full TCP handshake.                                                                      |
| -sU             | UDP scan: Sends UDP packets to the target ports and analyzes responses to determine if they are open, closed, or filtered. Since UDP is connectionless, this scan type relies on responses from services running on those ports, which may not always be reliable.                                        |
| -sV             | Service Version Detection: Attempts to determine the version and nature of services running on open ports by analyzing responses. This can provide valuable information for further assessment and exploitation of vulnerabilities associated with specific service versions.                              |
| -O              | Operating System Detection: Tries to determine the operating system running on the target machine by analyzing various network characteristics such as TTL values, TCP/IP stack behavior, and more. This can help in understanding the target environment better.                                       |
| -A              | Aggressive Scan: Combines various scan types (SYN scan, version detection, OS detection, traceroute, and script scanning) to gather as much information as possible about the target system. This can be more intrusive and resource-intensive but provides comprehensive results.                 |
| -p              | Specifies target ports or port ranges to scan. For example, `-p80` scans port 80, `-p1-1000` scans ports 1 through 1000, and `-p-` scans all 65535 ports.                                                                                                                                              |
| -T              | Timing Template: Adjusts the timing and speed of the scan. There are predefined timing templates ranging from "Paranoid" (slow and stealthy) to "Insane" (fast and aggressive), allowing users to balance between scan speed and stealthiness according to their needs.                             |
| -v              | Verbose Output: Increases the verbosity level of the scan results, providing more detailed information about the scanning process, targets, and responses. This flag can be repeated (`-vv`) to increase verbosity further.                                                                                    |
| -iL             | Input from List: Specifies a file containing a list of target IP addresses or hostnames to scan. This allows scanning multiple targets in a single command by reading them from a text file.                                                                                                           |

These flags are just a subset of the extensive options available in Nmap, providing users with flexibility and control over their scanning activities. It's important to use Nmap responsibly and in compliance with legal and ethical guidelines.

These examples demonstrate how to use some of the most commonly used flags in Nmap for performing network reconnaissance and security scanning. It's important to use Nmap responsibly and ethically, ensuring compliance with legal regulations and obtaining proper authorization before scanning networks.

## TCP SYN scan

A TCP SYN scan, often referred to as a "half-open" scan, is a type of port scanning method used by network administrators and security professionals to determine which ports on a target system are open, closed, or filtered. This scan works by sending a SYN (synchronize) packet to the target port and analyzing the response.

Here's how a TCP SYN scan typically works:

1. **SYN Packet Sent**: The scanning tool (e.g., Nmap) sends a TCP SYN packet to the target system's ports that need to be scanned. The SYN packet contains the destination port number and a randomly generated sequence number.

2. **Response Analysis**:
   - If the port is open: The target system responds with a SYN-ACK (synchronize-acknowledgment) packet. This indicates that the port is open and waiting for a connection.
   - If the port is closed: The target system responds with a RST (reset) packet. This indicates that the port is closed, and no service is listening on that port.
   - If the port is filtered: If there is no response or an ICMP error message (such as "Destination Unreachable") is received, it suggests that the port may be filtered by a firewall or other network device. This means that the scanning tool did not receive a definitive response from the target system.

3. **No Full Connection Establishment**: Unlike a full TCP connect scan, which completes the TCP three-way handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK), a TCP SYN scan does not establish a full connection with the target system. This makes it less detectable and intrusive compared to other scanning methods.

Advantages of TCP SYN Scan:
- Stealthy: Since a full TCP connection is not established, TCP SYN scans are less likely to be detected by intrusion detection systems (IDS) or firewall logs.
- Faster: SYN scanning can be faster than other scanning methods because it does not wait for a full TCP handshake to complete.

However, there are some limitations and considerations:
- SYN scans may not accurately detect the state of certain ports that require a full connection to reveal their state (e.g., some UDP ports).
- Some target systems may be configured to detect and respond to SYN scans, although this is less common than with other scanning methods.

Overall, TCP SYN scanning is a powerful and commonly used technique for network reconnaissance and vulnerability assessment due to its speed and stealthiness. It's important for security professionals to use SYN scans responsibly and in accordance with legal and ethical guidelines.
