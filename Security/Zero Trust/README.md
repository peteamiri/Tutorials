# Zero Trust Security Framework

Zero trust (ZT) is the term for an evolving set of cybersecurity paradigms that move defenses from static, network-based perimeters to focus on users, assets, and resources. Zero trust assumes there is no implicit trust granted to assets or user accounts based solely on their physical or network location (i.e., local area networks versus the internet) or based on asset ownership (enterprise or personally owned). Authentication and authorization (both subject and device) are discrete functions performed before a session to an enterprise resource is established.Zero Trust is a security framework for network infrustructure that operates under the assumption that no one should be trusted by default, and instead emphasizes the importance of validating and verifying all users and devices attempting to access a network or system.

This framework aims to improve cybersecurity by minimizing the potential risk of internal and external threats. In a Zero Trust model, access to resources is granted only after a user's (whether internal or external users) identity and other factors have been authenticated (aauthanticatred and autorized) and all other security protocols have been met. It provides a collection of concepts and ideas designed to minimize uncertainty in enforcing accurate , least privilege per-request access decision

Zero Trust assumes that there is no traditional network edge; networks can be local, in the cloud, or a combination or hybrid with resources anywhere as well as workers in any location.

Zero Trust is a framework for securing infrastructure and data for today’s modern digital transformation. It uniquely addresses the modern challenges of today’s business, including securing remote workers, hybrid cloud environments, and ransomware threats. While many vendors have tried to create their own definitions of Zero Trust, there are a number of standards from recognized organizations that can help you align Zero Trust with your organization.


A zero trust architecture (ZTA) uses zero trust principles to plan industrial and enterprise infrastructure and workflows.

Zero trust is a response to enterprise network trends that include remote users, bring your own device (BYOD), and cloud-based assets that are not located within an enterpriseowned network boundary. Zero trust focuses on protecting resources (assets, services, workflows, network accounts, etc.), not network segments, as the network location is no longer seen as the prime component to the security posture of the resource. This document contains an abstract definition of zero trust architecture (ZTA) and gives general deployment models and use cases where zero trust could improve an enterprise’s overall information technology security posture.

## Zero Trust and NIST 800-207

NIST SP 800-207 is a special publication of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) that provides guidelines for implementing a Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) within an organization's cybersecurity infrastructure .

ZTA is a cybersecurity approach that assumes all users, devices, and network traffic are untrusted each must be authanticated, and every action must be authorizaton must be varified before access is granted. NIST SP 800-207 provides an industry-neutral starting point for implementing ZTA in an organization's cybersecurity strategy.

## Zero Trust vs. Zero Trust Archiitect

The term "zero trust" generally refers to the concept of not trusting users, devices, or applications by default, regardless of their location or context. In contrast, "zero trust architecture" (ZTA) is a cybersecurity framework that operates on the principle of maintaining strict access controls and not trusting anyone by default, whether they are inside or outside a network perimeter. In other words, ZTA is a specific implementation or approach to zero trust security, which includes a set of principles, processes, and technologies designed to secure the digital infrastructure of an organization. So, while "zero trust" is a broader concept, "zero trust architecture" is a specific cybersecurity framework that organizations can adopt to implement a zero trust security model.

## Zero Trust Archiitecture

Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) is a cybersecurity design framework that operates on the principle of maintaining strict access controls and not trusting anyone by default, whether they are inside or outside a network perimeter. It was developed to address the changing nature of IT environments, where traditional perimeter-based approaches to security are no longer sufficient. It emphasizes the importance of continuous verification and validation of the user's identity, device, and context before granting access to resources, regardless of their location. Rather than relying on a defined network perimeter to protect against attacks, ZTA focuses on securing individual resources and data by applying the principle of least privilege access. This approach helps
