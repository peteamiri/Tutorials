# Attack Vectors

## Cybersecurity attack vectors: Hosts
These are attacks that go straight to our devices or hosts in general.

* `Malware`: Includes all programs that introduce malicious codes (viruses, worms, Trojans) on our computers, causing multiple and invaluable damage.

* `Keyloggers`: Employs programs to collect everything that the user types via keyboard. They can even take screenshots.

* `Social engineering`: Obtaining confidential information from a person or organization to use it for malicious purposes. The most striking examples are phishing and spam.
Phishing: Consist in deceiving the users to obtain their confidential information by spoofing the identity of a body or Internet website.

* `Spam`: Unsolicited messages, commonly in the shape of ads, sent in a massive and repetitive manner. Email is the most used means for such attacks; but also instant messaging programs; and even unsolicited calls via cell phone.
Cybersecurity attack vectors: Network


## Attack vectors in cybersecurity: Active attacks

* `Spoofing`: Addresses to the use of techniques for identity theft.
Modification: Consists in modifying the routing table so that the sender sends message through longer paths causing major delays.
DDoS: Attack of Denial of Service (DDoS) is to keep busy consuming network bandwidth with constant messages that disrupt normal service delivery.

* `Fabrication`: False routing message generated to prevent information of reaching its destination.

## Attack vectors in cybersecurity: Passive attacks

* `Sniffing or traffic analysis`: An attacker detects the communication path between sender and receiver. Following, finds the amount of data moving between sender and receiver. There are no changes in the data.

* `Eavesdropping`: Occurs in the ad-hoc mobile network. The main objective of this attack is finding out secret or confidential information by intercepting the means of communication.

* `Supervision`: Attack where hackers can read confidential data, but cannot edit it.
