# 5 Phases of the attach

* **Reconnaissance:** The reconnaissance phase is often the most time-consuming. This phase can last days, weeks, or even months  sometimes depending on the target. The objective during the reconnaissance phase is to learn as much as possible about the potential target.

* **Scanning:** In this phase the hacker will scan for exploitable vulnerabilities in the network. These scans will look for weaknesses such as open ports, open services, outdated applications (including operating systems), and the type of equipment being used on the network.

* **Access:** In this phase the hacker will use the knowledge gained in the previous phases to gain access to sensitive data or use the network to attack other targets. The objective of this phase is to have the attacker gain some level of control over other devices on the network.

* **Maintaining access:** During this phase a hacker will look at various options, such as creating a backdoor to maintain access to devices they have compromised. By creating a backdoor, a hacker can maintain a persistent attack on a network, without fear of losing access to the devices they have gained control over. However, when a backdoor is created, it increases the chance of a hacker being discovered. Backdoors are noisy and often leave a large footprint for IDS to follow.

* **Covering your tracks:** This phase is about hiding the intrusion of the network by the hacker as to not alert any IDS that may be monitoring the network. The objective of this phase is to erase any trace that an attack occurred on the network.

# tools

* **Nmap :** is a great tool for both reconnaissance and scanning for network vulnerabilities.

* **Metasploit framework:** Some tools are grouped together to make toolkits and frameworks. The Metasploit framework is one of the most versatile and best supported hacking tool frameworks available. Metasploit is built around a collection of highly effective modules, such as msfvenom, and it provides access to an extensive database of exploits and vulnerabilities.

* **Rubber Ducky** is a USB payload injector that automatically injects a malicious virus into the device it's plugged into.

* **Wi-Fi Pineapple**  can act as a rogue router and it can be used to launch man-in-the-middle attacks. The Wi-Fi Pineapple also has a range of modules that allow it to execute multiple attack vectors. These types of tool are known as penetration testing equipment.

# Laws

* **Fraud and Abuse Act** passed on the 1986, this laws says it is illegal to access a computer without authorization and steal private government information or financial/credit card information. Breaking into a computer system is the technological version of trespassing.
