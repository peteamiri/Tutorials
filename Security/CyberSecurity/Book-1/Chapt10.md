# **Chapter 10: Cyber Incident Handling**  

## **10.1 Introduction to Cyber Incident Response**  
Cyber incidents refer to security breaches, unauthorized access, malware infections, and other malicious activities affecting digital systems. A **Cyber Incident Handling** framework ensures that organizations respond effectively to security events while minimizing damage.  

### **Goals of Incident Response:**  
- Detect and contain security incidents swiftly.  
- Eradicate threats while preserving operational integrity.  
- Recover systems with minimal downtime and data loss.  
- Improve defenses through post-incident analysis.  

## **10.2 Cyber Incident Response Frameworks**  
Various cybersecurity frameworks provide structured methods for managing incidents.  

### **Common Response Frameworks:**  
- **NIST Incident Response Lifecycle:** Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover.  
- **SANS Incident Response Methodology:** Preparation, Identification, Containment, Eradication, Recovery, and Lessons Learned.  
- **ISO 27035:** International standard for structured incident handling procedures.  

## **10.3 Phases of Incident Handling**  
A well-defined incident response process ensures quick and effective remediation.  

### **1. Preparation:**  
- Develop incident response plans.  
- Conduct cybersecurity training and simulations.  
- Establish communication protocols.  

### **2. Detection & Identification:**  
- Monitor security logs and alerts.  
- Utilize intrusion detection systems (IDS) and endpoint detection and response (EDR).  
- Analyze threat indicators such as unusual network behavior or system anomalies.  

### **3. Containment & Mitigation:**  
- Isolate affected systems to prevent further spread.  
- Disable compromised accounts or revoke credentials.  
- Implement temporary security patches.  

### **4. Eradication:**  
- Remove malware, backdoors, and unauthorized access points.  
- Conduct forensic analysis to ensure no residual threats remain.  
- Strengthen security measures to prevent reinfection.  

### **5. Recovery & Restoration:**  
- Validate system integrity before reconnecting to the network.  
- Restore lost data from secure backups.  
- Conduct security audits to confirm full recovery.  

### **6. Post-Incident Analysis & Lessons Learned:**  
- Identify weaknesses in security defenses.  
- Update response strategies based on findings.  
- Implement additional security controls to prevent recurrence.  

## **10.4 Incident Response Teams & Roles**  
Organizations assign specialized roles for effective incident management.  

### **Key Team Members:**  
- **Incident Commander:** Oversees the entire response operation.  
- **Security Analysts:** Investigate threats and determine attack vectors.  
- **Forensic Experts:** Gather digital evidence and analyze malicious activity.  
- **Legal & Compliance Team:** Ensures adherence to cybersecurity regulations.  
- **Public Relations & Communication:** Handles external messaging and stakeholder communication.  

## **10.5 Case Studies in Cyber Incident Handling**  
Real-world incidents highlight the importance of efficient response strategies.  

### **Examples:**  
- **Equifax Data Breach (2017):** Poor incident response delayed damage control, exposing millions of sensitive records.  
- **Capital One Hack (2019):** Insider threats led to unauthorized database access and customer data leaks.  
- **SolarWinds Supply Chain Attack (2020):** Attackers exploited software vulnerabilities, compromising numerous organizations worldwide.
