## **3.1 The Importance of Cybersecurity Regulations**  
As cyber threats continue to evolve, governments and organizations worldwide have developed regulatory frameworks to ensure security, privacy, and compliance. Cybersecurity laws help protect individuals, businesses, and national security from cybercrime, data breaches, and unauthorized access.  

### **Key Objectives of Cybersecurity Regulations:**  
- Safeguard personal and corporate data.  
- Establish accountability for organizations handling sensitive information.  
- Ensure compliance with industry security standards.  
- Prevent cyber fraud, hacking, and espionage.  

## **3.2 Global Cybersecurity Policies and Compliance Standards**  
Cybersecurity regulations vary by country, but several international standards influence security practices worldwide:  

### **United States:**  
- **HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act):** Protects sensitive health information.  
- **CISA (Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency):** Strengthens national cyber resilience.
