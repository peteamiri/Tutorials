# **Chapter 2: Fundamental Concepts in Cybersecurity**  

## **2.1 The CIA Triad: Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability**  
The **CIA Triad** is the foundation of cybersecurity, ensuring that information is protected in three key areas:  

- **Confidentiality** – Preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data through encryption, access controls, and authentication mechanisms.  
- **Integrity** – Ensuring data remains accurate and unaltered by malicious actors through hashing, digital signatures, and secure protocols.  
- **Availability** – Keeping systems and data accessible to authorized users through redundancy, failover mechanisms, and disaster recovery strategies.  

## **2.2 Risk Management Principles**  
Cybersecurity is not just about defense—it’s about **risk management**, balancing protection with usability. Organizations follow structured risk management processes:  

1. **Risk Identification** – Recognizing potential security threats and vulnerabilities.  
2. **Risk Assessment** – Evaluating the impact and likelihood of cyber risks.  
3. **Mitigation Strategies** – Implementing controls to reduce risk.  
4. **Continuous Monitoring** – Keeping security measures updated against evolving threats.  

## **2.3 Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Attacks**  
Understanding the difference between **threats, vulnerabilities, and attacks** is crucial in cybersecurity:  

- **Threats** – Potential dangers, including malware, phishing, and insider threats.  
- **Vulnerabilities** – Weaknesses in systems, such as outdated software or misconfigured settings.  
- **Attacks** – Exploits that take advantage of vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection or denial-of-service attacks.  

## **2.4 Cryptography Basics**  
Cryptography secures data through encryption, ensuring confidentiality and integrity. Important cryptographic concepts include:  

- **Symmetric Encryption** – Using the same key for encryption and decryption (e.g., AES).  
- **Asymmetric Encryption** – Using a public-private key pair for secure communication (e.g., RSA).  
- **Hashing** – Transforming data into fixed-length values for integrity verification (e.g., SHA-256).
