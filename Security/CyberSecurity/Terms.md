# Hacker Terms/Dictionary

<b>Adware</b> – Adware is software designed to force pre-chosen ads to display on your system. Some adware is designed to be malicious and will pop up ads with such speed and frequency that they seem to be taking over everything, slowing down your system and tying up all of your system resources. When adware is coupled with spyware, it can be a frustrating ride, to say the least.

<b>Back Door</b> – A back door is a point of entry that circumvents normal security and can be used by a cracker to access a network or computer system. Usually back doors are created by system developers as shortcuts to speed access through security during the development stage and then are overlooked and never properly removed during final implementation. Sometimes crackers will create their own back door to a system by using a virus or a Trojan to set it up, thereby allowing them future access at their leisure.

<b>Black Hat</b> – Just like in the old westerns, these are the bad guys. A black hat is a cracker. To add insult to injury, black hats may also share information about the “break in” with other black hat crackers so they can exploit the same vulnerabilities before the victim becomes aware and takes appropriate measures… like calling Global Digital Forensics!

<b>Bot</b> – A bot is a software “robot” that performs an extensive set of automated tasks on its own. Search engines like Google use bots, also known as spiders, to crawl through websites in order to scan through all of your pages. In these cases bots are not meant to interfere with a user, but are employed in an effort to index sites for the purpose of ranking them accordingly for appropriate returns on search queries. But when black hats use a bot, they can perform an extensive set of destructive tasks, as well as introduce many forms of malware to your system or network. They can also be used by black hats to coordinate attacks by controlling botnets.

<b>Botnet</b> – A botnet is a network of zombie drones under the control of a black hat. When black hats are launching a Distributed Denial of Service attack for instance, they will use a botnet under their control to accomplish it. Most often, the users of the systems will not even know they are involved or that their system resources are being used to carry out DDOS attacks or for spamming. It not only helps cover the black hat’s tracks, but increases the ferocity of the attack by using the resources of many computer systems in a coordinated effort.

<b>Cookies</b> – A cookie is a small packet of information from a visited webserver stored on your system by your computer’s browser. It is designed to store personalized information in order to customize your next visit. For instance, if you visit a site with forms to fill out on each visit, that information can be stored on your system as a cookie so you don’t have to go through the process of filling out the forms each time you visit.

<b>Cracker</b> – When you hear the word hacker today, in reality it is normally referring to a cracker, but the two have become synonymous. With its origin derived from “safe-cracker” as a way to differentiate from the various uses of “hacker” in the cyber world, a cracker is someone who breaks into a computer system or network without authorization and with the intention of doing damage. A cracker may destroy files, steal personal information like credit card numbers or client data, infect the system with a virus, or undertake many others things that cause harm. This glossary will give you an idea of what they can do and some of the means they use to achieve their malicious objectives. These are the black hats.

<b>Denial of Service Attack (DOS)</b> – A Denial of Service attack is an attack designed to overwhelm a targeted website to the point of crashing it or making it inaccessible. Along with sheer numbers and frequency, sometimes the data packets that are sent are malformed to further stress the system trying to process the server requests. A successful Denial of Service attack can cripple any entity that relies on its online presence by rendering their website virtually useless.

<b>Distributed Denial of Service Attack (DDOS)</b> – A Distributed Denial of Service attack is done with the help of zombie drones (also known as a botnet) under the control of black hats using a master program to command them to send information and data packets to the targeted webserver from the multiple systems under their control. This obviously makes the Distributed Denial of Service attack even more devastating than a Denial of Service attack launched from a single system, flooding the target server with a speed and volume that is exponentially magnified. As is normally the case with zombie drones and botnets, this is often done without the user of the controlled system even knowing they were involved.

<b>Dumpster Diving</b> – The act of rummaging through the trash of an individual or business to gather information that could be useful for a cyber criminal to gain access to a system or attain personal information to aid them in identity theft or system intrusion. One person’s garbage can indeed be a cyber criminal’s treasure.

<b>Easter Egg</b> – A non-malicious surprise contained in a program or on a circuit board installed by the developer. It could be as simple as a text greeting, a signature, or an image embedded on a circuit board, or comprise a more complex routine, like a video or a small program. The criteria that must be met to be considered an Easter Egg are that it be undocumented, non-malicious, reproducible to anyone with the same device or software, not be obvious, and above all</b> – it should be entertaining!

<b>Firewall</b> – A firewall is a security barrier designed to keep unwanted intruders “outside” a computer system or network while allowing safe communication between systems and users on the “inside” of the firewall. Firewalls can be physical devices or software-based, or a combination of the two. A well designed and implemented firewall is a must to ensure safe communications and network access and should be regularly checked and updated to ensure continued function. Black hats learn new tricks and exploit new techniques all the time, and what worked to keep them out yesterday may need to be adjusted or replaced over time.

<b>Gray Hat</b> – A gray hat, as you would imagine, is a bit of a white hat/black hat hybrid. Thankfully, like white hats, their mission is not to do damage to a system or network, but to expose flaws in system security. The black hat part of the mix is that they may very well use illegal means to gain access to the targeted system or network, but not for the purpose of damaging or destroying data: they want to expose the security weaknesses of a particular system and then notify the “victim” of their success. Often this is done with the intent of then selling their services to help correct the security failure so black hats can not gain entry and/or access for more devious and harmful purposes.

<b>Hacker</b> – This is the trickiest definition of the group and controversy has followed its use for decades. Originally, the term hacker had a positive connotation and it actually had nothing to do with computer systems. In 1946, the Tech Model Railroad Club of MIT coined the term to mean someone who applies ingenuity to achieve a clever result. Then, when computers came along, ”hacker” took on the meaning of someone who would “hack” away on a program through the night to make it better. But in the 80s everything changed, and Hollywood was the catalyst. When the personal computers onslaught started invading our daily lives, it didn’t take long for clever screen-writers to bring the black hat villains of the cyber world to the forefront of our collective consciousness, and they haven’t looked back since. They associated our deepest fears with the word hacker, making them the ones that unraveled our privacy, put our safety in jeopardy, and had the power to take everything from us, from our material possessions to our very identities. And they could do it all anonymously, by hacking away in a dark room by the dim light of a computer monitor’s glow. Needless to say, right or wrong, it stuck! Even many professionals in the computing field today have finally, albeit grudgingly, given in to the mainstream meaning of the word. “Hacker” has thus become the catch-all term used when in fact it should be “cracker.”

<b>Keylogger</b> – A keylogger is a non-destructive program that is designed to log every keystroke made on a computer. The information that is collected can then be saved as a file and/or sent to another machine on the network or over the Internet, making it possible for someone else to see every keystroke that was made on a particular system. By breaking down this information, it can be easy for a black hat cracker to recreate your user names and passwords, putting all kinds of information at risk and susceptible to misuse. Just imagine your online banking login information falling into the wrong hands! Finding out you have a keylogger installed, however, does not necessarily mean you were the victim of a black hat, as some companies install them on employee computers to track usage and ensure that systems are not being used for unintended purposes. Keyloggers are, for obvious reasons, often considered to be spyware.

<b>Logic Bomb</b> – A logic bomb is a malicious program designed to execute when a certain criterion is met. A time bomb could be considered a logic bomb because when the target time or date is reached, it executes. But logic bombs can be much more complex. They can be designed to execute when a certain file is accessed, or when a certain key combination is pressed, or through the passing of any other event or task that is possible to be tracked on a computer. Until the trigger event the logic bomb was designed for passes, it will simply remain dormant.

<b>Malware</b> – Simply put, malware is a malicious program that causes damage. It includes viruses, Trojans, worms, time bombs, logic bombs, or anything else intended to cause damage upon the execution of the payload.

<b>Master Program</b> – A master program is the program a black hat cracker uses to remotely transmit commands to infected zombie drones, normally to carry out Denial of Service attacks or spam attacks.

<b>Payload</b> – The payload is the part of the malware program that actually executes its designed task.

<b>Phishing</b> – Phishing is a form of social engineering carried out by black hats in electronic form, usually by email, with the purpose of gathering sensitive information. Often these communications will look legitimate and sometimes they will even look like they come from a legitimate source like a social networking site, a well-known entity like Paypal or Ebay, or even your bank. They will have a link directing you to a site that looks very convincing and ask you to verify your account information. When you log in to verify your information on the bogus site, you have just given the black hat exactly what they need to make you the next victim of cyber crime. Phishing is done in many forms</b> – sometimes it’s easy to spot, sometimes not.

<b>Phreaker</b> – Considered the original computer hackers, phreakers, or phone phreakers, hit the scene in the 60s and made their mark by circumventing telecommunications security systems to place calls, including long distance, for free. By using electronic recording devices, or even simply creating tones with a whistle, phreakers tricked the systems into thinking it was a valid call. One of the first to find prominence was “Captain Crunch,” a phreaker who realized the toy whistle that came as a prize in a box of Captain Crunch cereal could be used to mimic the tone frequencies used by telecommunications companies to validate and route calls.

<b>Polymorphic Virus</b> – A polymorphic virus is a virus that will change its digital footprint every time it replicates. Antivirus software relies on a constantly updated and evolving database of virus signatures to detect any virus that may have infected a system. By changing its signature upon replication, a polymorphic virus may elude antivirus software, making it very hard to eradicate.

<b>Rootkit</b> – Without a doubt, the biggest fear in IT security is an undetected intrusion. A rootkit is a tool that can give a black hat the means for just such a perfect heist. A rootkit is a malware program that is installed on a system through various means, including the same methods that allow viruses to be injected into a system, like email, websites designed to introduce malware, or downloading and/or copying to the system with an unsafe program. Once a rootkit is introduced, this will create a back door for a black hat that will allow remote, unauthorized entry whenever he or she chooses. What makes a rootkit particularly lethal: it is installed and functions at such low system levels that it can be designed to erase its own tracks and activity from the now vulnerable system, allowing the black hat to navigate through entire networks without being exposed. Often, black hats will use social engineering to gain physical access to particularly well protected system so the rootkit can be directly installed from CD or a tiny USB drive (it only takes a minute) in order either to circumvent a particularly troublesome firewall or gain access to a system that is not normally accessible from the outside. Once the rootkit is introduced, the black hat has free reign and even skilled IT security departments will have a lot of trouble even seeing the activity as it’s happening. Rootkits are a definite 10 on the scary scale of cyber intrusions.

<b>Script Kiddie</b> – An individual who does not possess, or just doesn’t use, their own skills and know-how to hack or crack a computer system or network, but uses a pre-written program or piece of code, a script, to do the dirty work. While they may not possess the computing talent, they can be just as dangerous!

<b>Social Engineering</b> – In the realm of the black hats, social engineering means to deceive someone for the purpose of acquiring sensitive and personal information, like credit card details or user names and passwords. For instance, when fictitious Mr. Smith calls from IT services to inform you of new user name and password guidelines being implemented by the company and asks you to reveal yours so he can make sure they meet the new guidelines, you have been a target of social engineering. They can be very clever and resourceful, and very, very convincing. The only way to make sure you are not a victim of social engineering is never to give your personal and sensitive information to anyone you are not absolutely sure about. There are very few occasions that anyone legitimate would ever ask you for a password, and you should always be the one contacting them, not the other way around.

<b>Spam</b> – Spam is simply unsolicited email, also known as junk email. Spammers gather lists of email addresses, which they use to bombard users with this unsolicited mail. Often, the emails sent are simply advertising for a product or a service, but sometimes they can be used for phishing and/or directing you to websites or products that will introduce malware to your system. When you receive spam, the best practice is to delete it immediately. Sometimes you will see a note in a spam email that gives you instructions on how to be removed from the list</b> – never do it! This will only confirm to the spammer that they have a valid email address and the spam will just keep coming. They could also then sell your email address to another spammer as a confirmed email address and more spam will show up in your inbox. Most mail services have spam filters and these should be employed whenever possible.

<b>Spoofing</b> – Spoofing is the art of misdirection. Black hat crackers will often cover their tracks by spoofing (faking) an IP address or masking/changing the sender information on an email so as to deceive the recipient as to its origin. For example, they could send you an email containing a link to a page that will infect your system with malware and make it look like it came from a safe source, such as a trusted friend or well-known organization. Most of the true sources have security measures in place to avoid tampering with sender information on their own mail servers, but as many black hat spammers will launch attacks from their own SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol), they will be able to tamper with that information. When in doubt, check with the source yourself.

<b>Spyware</b> – Spyware is software designed to gather information about a user’s computer use without their knowledge. Sometimes spyware is simply used to track a user’s Internet surfing habits for advertising purposes in an effort to match your interests with relevant ads. On the other side of the coin, spyware can also scan computer files and keystrokes, create pop-up ads, change your homepage and/or direct you to pre-chosen websites. One common use is to generate a pop-up ad informing you that your system has been infected with a virus or some other form of malware and then force you to a pre-selected page that has the solution to fix the problem. Most often, spyware is bundled with free software like screen savers, emoticons and social networking programs.

<b>Time Bomb</b> – A time bomb is a malicious program designed to execute at a predetermined time and/or date. Time bombs are often set to trigger on special days like holidays, or sometimes they mark things like Hitler’s birthday or 9/11 to make some sort of political statement. What a time bomb does on execution could be something benign like showing a certain picture, or it could be much more damaging, like stealing, deleting, or corrupting system information. Until the trigger time is achieved, a time bomb will simply remain dormant.

<b>Trojan</b> – A Trojan, or Trojan Horse, is a malicious program disguised to look like a valid program, making it difficult to distinguish from programs that are supposed to be there. Once introduced, a Trojan can destroy files, alter information, steal passwords or other information, or fulfill any other sinister purpose it was designed to accomplish. Or it may stay dormant, waiting for a cracker to access it remotely and take control of the system. A Trojan is a lot like a virus, but without the ability to replicate.

<b>Virus</b> – A virus is a malicious program or code that attaches itself to another program file and can replicate itself and thereby infect other systems. Just like the flu virus, it can spread from one system to another when the infected program is used by another system. The more interconnected the host is, the better its chances to spread. The spread of a virus can easily occur on networked systems, or it could even be passed along on other media like a CD or memory stick when a user unwittingly copies an infected file and introduces it to a new system. A virus could even be emailed with an attachment. “Virus” is often incorrectly used as a catch-all phrase for other malicious programs that don’t have the ability to self-replicate, like spyware and adware.

<b>Wardriving</b> – Wardriving is the act of driving around in a vehicle with the purpose of finding an open, unsecured Wi-Fi wireless network. Many times, the range of a wireless network will exceed the perimeter of a building and create zones in public places that can be exploited to gain entry to the network. Black hats, and even gray hats, will often use a GPS system to make maps of exploitable zones so they can be used at a later time or passed on to others. Wardriving is not the only way this task is performed</b> – there are Warbikers and Warwalkers too. As you can see, it is imperative that your WiFi network is secure because there are entities out there looking for any opening to ply their trade.

<b>White Hat</b> – While black hats use their skill for malicious purposes, white hats are ethical hackers. They use their knowledge and skill to thwart the black hats and secure the integrity of computer systems or networks. If a black hat decides to target you, it’s a great thing to have a white hat around. But if you don’t, you can always call on one of ours at Global Digital Forensics.

<b>Worm</b> – A worm is very similar to a virus in that it is a destructive self-contained program that can replicate itself. But unlike a virus, a worm does not need to be a part of another program or document. A worm can copy and transfer itself to other systems on a network, even without user intervention. A worm can become devastating if not isolated and removed. Even if it does not cause outright damage, a worm replicating out of control can exponentially consume system resources like memory and bandwidth until a system becomes unstable and unusable.

<b>Zero Day Threat/Exploit</b> – Every threat to your computer security has to start somewhere. Unfortunately, the way most of us protect ourselves from cyber threats and intrusions, is to use detection programs that are based on analyzing, comparing and matching the digital footprint of a possible threat to an internal database of threats that have been previously detected, reported and documented. That’s why we all have to go through those seemingly never-ending updates to our antivirus programs, that’s how the database is updated and the newest threats are added to the list of what the scanners look for. That inherent flaw in our scanners is what makes a Zero Day threat so dangerous. A Zero Day threat is pristine and undocumented. From the very first day a particular threat is ever deployed (zero day) until that threat is noticed, reported, documented and added to the index, it is an unknown. As far as standard protection goes, unknown means invisible</b> – and when it comes to cyber threats, invisible can definitely mean trouble.

<b>Zombie / Zombie Drone</b> – A zombie is a malware program that can be used by a black hat cracker to remotely take control of a system so it can be used as a zombie drone for further attacks, like spam emails or Denial of Service attacks, without a user’s knowledge. This helps cover the black hat’s tracks and increases the magnitude of their activities by using your resources for their own devious purposes. Rarely will the user infected with a zombie even know it’s there, as zombies are normally benign and non-destructive in and of themselves. Zombies can be introduced to a system by simply opening an infected email attachment, but most often they are received through non-mainstream sites like file sharing sites, chat groups, adult websites and online casinos that force you to download their media player to have access to the content on their site, using the installed player itself as the delivery mechanism.

* Botnet: A combination of the words “robot” and “network”, a botnet is a network of computers that have been infected with a virus, and now are working continuously in order to create security breaches. These attacks come in the form of Bitcoin mining, sending spam e-mails, and DDoS attacks (see below).

* Data Breach: The result of a hacker successfully breaking into a system, gaining control of its network and exposing its data, usually personal data covering items such as credit card numbers, bank account numbers, Social Security numbers, and more.

* DDoS: The acronym stands for Distributed Denial of Service and is a favorite Black Hat tool. Using multiple hosts and users, hackers bombard a website with a tidal wave of requests to such an extent that it locks up the system and forces it to temporarily shut down.

* Domain: A series of computers and associated peripherals (routers, printers, scanners), that are all connected as one entity.

* Encryption: Coding used to protect your information from hackers. Think of it like the code cipher used to send a top-secret coded spy message.

* Exploit: A means of attack on a computer system, either a series of commands, malicious software, or piece of infected data. Note that in this context, “exploit” is a noun, not a verb, as in “The hacker used a malware exploit to gain access to the credit card’s server.”

* Firewall: Any technology, be it software or hardware, used to keep intruders out.

* Hacker, Black Hat: Any hacker who attempts to gain unauthorized access to a system with the intent to cause mischief, damage, or theft. They can be motivated by greed, a political agenda, or simply boredom.

* Hacker, White Hat: A hacker who is invited to test out computer systems and servers, looking for vulnerabilities, for the purposes of informing the host of where security needs to be buffed up. They are benign hackers, personifying the old axiom “It takes a thief to catch a thief”. Sometimes called “ethical hackers.”

* Malware: A portmanteau of “malicious” and “software”, describing a wide variety of bad software used to infect and/or damage a system. Ransomware, worms, viruses, and trojans are all considered malware. It most often delivered via spam emails.

* Man in the Middle Attack
An attack on the “middleman”, in this case, defined as the Wi-Fi system that connects users to the Internet. Hackers who commit Man in the Middle Attacks can break the Wi-Fi’s encryption and use this as a means of stealing your personal data because they’re now in the system.

* Phishing: A scam where a hacker poses as a legitimate business or organization (especially credit card companies, banks, charities, Internet providers, other utilities) in order to fool the victim into giving them sensitive personal information or inducing them to click a link or attachment that ends up delivering malware. Some of these schemes are extremely well done, others are sloppy and amateurish and can be spotted with just a little extra vigilance.

* Ransomware: A form of malware that hijacks your system and encrypts your files, denying you access to them until you send money to unlock everything. In other words, it kidnaps your computer and holds it for ransom, hence the clever name.

* Spoofing: it’s when a hacker changes the IP address of an email so that it seems to come from a trusted source.

* Spyware: A form of malware used by hackers to spy on you and your computer activities. If a mobile device such as a smartphone is infected with spyware, a hacker can read your text messages, redirect your phone calls, and even track down where you are physically located!

* Trojan Horse: Yet another form of malware, this one a misleading computer program that looks innocent, but in fact allows the hacker into your system via a back door, allowing them to control your computer.

* Virus: Malware which changes, corrupts, or destroys information, and is then passed on to other systems, usually by otherwise benign means (e.g. sending an email). In some cases, a virus can actually cause physical damage.

* VPN: An acronym standing for Virtual Private Network, a VPN is a method of connecting a series of computers and devices in a private encrypted network, with each user’s IP address being replaced by the VPN’s IP address. Users get Internet anonymity, making it difficult for hackers to attack.

* Worm: Malware that can reproduce itself for the purposes of spreading itself to other computers in the network. Particularly nasty, worms can either be simply a means of slowing down a system by eating up resources, or by committing exploits such as installing back doors or stealing data.

* Cloud: You already utilize cloud computing if you use Gmail for email, Google Drive for document storage, or Netflix to stream your favorite movies. These services are all built on the cloud. cloud computing is providing on-demand services over the internet.If you want to run a business and you need to keep user data and you decide to do it on a hard drive, you will need a lot of storage space and a tech staff for it.Cloud service providers like Microsoft Azure, AWS, and Google Cloud, which offer on-demand services and are both cost-effective and low-risk in terms of security, make this procedure simple.

* Software: It is a group of applications that instruct a computer to carry out a task. In which Users can download and use a package that contains these instructions.A hard drive or magnetic diskette are common examples of external long-term memory devices where software is often kept. When it is in use the computer reads the program from the storage device and temporarily stores the instructions in random access memory (RAM). Google Chrome is one such example of application software.

* IP Address: The world IP stands for Internet Protocol. An IP address is a series of numbers allocated to computers routers  servers, and pretty much anything connected to the Internet, including websites. It functions very similarly to a standard address, allowing users to find any system or device on the global network by specifying its location

* Rootkit: A rootkit is a collection of programs or software tools that allow hackers to remotely access and control a computer or network. Although rootkits do not directly damage users, they have been used for other purposes that are legal, such as remote end-user support. However, the majority of rootkits either leverage the system for additional network security attacks or open a backdoor on the targeted systems for the introduction of malware, viruses, and ransomware. Typically, a rootkit is installed without the victim's knowledge via a stolen password or by taking advantage of system flaws. In order to avoid being picked up by endpoint antivirus software, rootkits are typically employed in conjunction with other malware.

* BYOD (Bring Your Own Device): Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) is a company policy that permits, encourages, or mandates employees to access enterprise systems and data using their own personal devices, such as laptops, tablets, and smartphones, for work-related activities.

* Pen-testing: An approach to security evaluation where manual exploitations and automated techniques are used by attack and security professionals. Only environments with a solid security infrastructure should employ this advanced kind of security evaluation  with a mature security infrastructure. Penetration tests can disrupt operations and harm systems because they employ the same equipment, procedures, and methodology as malicious hackers

* Social Engineering: Instead of breaking in or utilizing technical hacking techniques, social engineering is a growingly popular way to access restricted resources. This strategy relies on user manipulation and human psychology. An employee might get an email from a social engineer purporting to be from the IT department in order to deceive him into disclosing private information rather than trying to uncover a software weakness in a company system. Spear phishing assaults are built on a foundation of social engineering.

* Clickjacking: While someone is tricked into clicking on one object on a web page when they want to click on another, this practice is known as clickjacking. In this manner, the attacker is able to use the victim's click against them. Clickjacking can be used to enable the victim's webcam, install malware, or access one of their online accounts.

* Deepfake: A piece of audio or video that has been altered and changed to make it seem authentic or credible. The most perilous aspect of the prevalence of deepfakes is that they can easily convince individuals into believing a particular tale or idea, which may lead to user behavior that has a greater impact on society at large, such as in the political or financial spheres.

* Multi-Factor Authentication: Multi-factor authentication (MFA), also referred to as two-factor authentication, makes it more difficult for hackers to access your account by requiring you to provide at least two different credentials. MFA requires a second factor to confirm your identity in addition to your username and password, such as a one-time security code, a fingerprint scan, or a face recognition scan.

* User Authentication: A technique to prevent unauthorized users from accessing sensitive data is user authentication. For instance, User A can only see data that is relevant and cannot view User B's sensitive information.

* Antivirus: The newest virus detection technology is integrated into anti-virus systems to shield users against viruses, spyware, trojans, and worms that can damage computer hardware through email or web browsing.

* Ethical Hacking: With the owner's permission, breaches the network to obtain sensitive information—completely legal. Typically, this technique is used to check for infrastructure weaknesses.

* Cyber Attack: Any attempt to breach a logical environment's security boundary. An attack may concentrate on intelligence gathering, disrupting company operations, exploiting weaknesses, keeping track of targets, stopping work, obtaining value, harming logical or physical assets, or leveraging system resources to enable assaults against other targets.

* Network: Two or more computers connected together to share resources (such printers and CDs), exchange files, or enable electronic communications make up a network. A network's connections to its computers can be made by cables, phone lines, radio waves, satellites, or infrared laser beams.

* Internet of Things: The phrase "Internet of Things" (IoT) refers to commonplace items that are connected to the internet and are capable of autonomously collecting and transferring data without requiring human input. Any physical thing that can be given an IP address and can transport data is considered to be a part of the Internet of Things, which also includes traditional computers, vehicles, CCTV cameras, household appliances, and even people.

* Penetration Test: A penetration test, commonly referred to as a pen test, simulates a cyberattack on your computer system to look for weaknesses that could be exploited.Pen testing involves attempting to get into any number of application systems (such as frontend/backend servers, APIs, etc.) in order to find security holes like unsanitized inputs that are vulnerable to code injection attacks.

Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)
In an APT attack, a threat actor uses the most sophisticated tactics and technologies to penetrate a high-profile network. APTs aim to stay ‘under the radar’ and explore the network while remaining undetected for weeks, months, and even years. APTs are most often used by nation-state threat actors wishing to cause severe disruption and damage to the economic and political stability of a country. They can be considered the cyber equivalent of espionage ‘sleeper cells’.

Advanced Threat Protection (ATP)
Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) are security solutions that defend against sophisticated malware or hacking attacks targeting sensitive data. Advanced Threat Protection includes both software and managed security services.

Adware
Adware bombards users with endless ads and pop-up windows and causes a nuisance to the user experience. Adware can also pose a real danger to devices and the unwanted ads can include malware or redirect user searches to malicious websites that collect personal data about users. Adware programs are often built into freeware or shareware programs, where the adware operator collects an indirect fee for using the program. Adware programs usually do not show themselves in the system in any way. Adware programs seldom include a de-installation procedure, and attempts to remove them manually may cause the original carrier program to malfunction. Read more

Anti-Botnet
Anti-Botnet tools automatically generate botnet checks when a user browses a website. If a risk is detected, it sends back a warning message to the device. The most common anti-botnet solution is CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart). Read more on Allot’s solutions for Home Security.

Botnet
A Botnet is a collection of compromised computers running malicious programs that are controlled remotely by a C&C (command & control) server operated by a cyber-criminal. Cybercriminals exercise remote control through automated processes (bots) in public IRC channels or websites. (Such websites may either be run directly by the ‘bot herder,’ or they may be legitimate websites that have been subverted for this purpose.) Read more on Allot’s solutions for Home Security.

Brute Force Attack
This is a method for guessing a password (or the key used to encrypt a message) that involves systematically trying a high volume of possible combinations of characters until the correct one is found. One way to reduce the susceptibility to a Brute Force Attack is to limit the number of permitted attempts to enter a password – for example, by allowing only three failed attempts and then permitting further attempts only after 15 minutes.

Business Continuity Plan
A Business Continuity Plan is an organization’s playbook for how to operate in an emergency situation, like a massive cyberattack. The business continuity plan provides safeguards against a disaster and outlines the strategies and action plan on how to continue business as usual in the event of any large-scale cyber event. Read more on Allot’s solutions for Business Security.

Clickjacking
Clickjacking involves tricking someone into clicking on one object on a web page while they think they are clicking on another. The attacker loads a transparent page over the legitimate content on the web page so that the victim thinks they are clicking on a legitimate item when they are really clicking on something on the attacker’s invisible page. This way, the attacker can hijack the victim’s click for their own purposes. Clickjacking could be used to install malware, gain access to one of the victim’s online accounts, or enable the victim’s webcam.

Clientless
Clientless refers to a program that is run entirely from the network, without requiring any installation of software on the endpoint device running the program. Code Injection Code Injection is commonly used by malware to evade detection by antivirus and anti-malware programs by injecting malicious code into a legitimate process. This way the legitimate process serves as camouflage so all anti-malware tools can see running is the legitimate process and thus obfuscates the malicious code execution.

COTS (Commercial off-the Shelf)
Commercial off-the Shelf or Commercially Available off the Shelf (COTS) products are packaged solutions that are then adapted to satisfy the needs of the purchasing organization, rather than the commissioning of custom-made, or bespoke, solutions.

Critical Infrastructure
Critical Infrastructure represents the fundamental systems of an organization that is important for its survival and where any threat to such basic systems would endanger the entire organization.

Cryptojacking
Cryptojacking consists of hackers using the computing power of a compromised device to generate or “mine” cryptocurrency without the owner’s knowledge. Mining can be performed either by installing a malicious program on the target computer or through various kinds of fileless malware. Sometimes attackers take over part of the computer’s processing power when a page containing a special mining script is opened. Cryptojacking has been known to occur when viewing online ads or solving a CAPTCHA.

Cyberbullying
Cyberbullying is the use of electronic means, primarily messaging and social media platforms, to bully and harass a victim. Cyberbullying has become a major problem, especially affecting young people, as it allows bullies to magnify their aggressive behavior, publicly ridicule victims on a large scale, and carry out damaging activities in a way that is difficult for parents and teachers to detect.

Cybersecurity
Cybersecurity relates to processes employed to safeguard and secure assets used to carry information of an organization from being stolen or attacked. It requires extensive knowledge of possible threats such as viruses or other malicious objects. Identity management, risk management, and incident management form the crux of the cybersecurity strategies of an organization. Read more

Dark Web
The Dark Web is encrypted parts of the internet that are not indexed by search engines, most notoriously used by all types of criminals including; pedophiles, illicit human and contraband traffickers, and cyber criminals, to communicate and share information without being detected or identified by law enforcement. Malware of all types can be purchased on the dark web. A subset of the deep web, which can be accessed by anyone with the correct URL, dark web pages need special software (ex. Tor) with the correct decryption key and access rights and knowledge to find content. Users of the dark web remain almost completely anonymous due to its P2P network connections which makes network activity very difficult to trace.

Data Breach
A Data Breach is the event of a hacker successfully exploits a network or device vulnerability and gains access to its files and data.

Data Integrity
Data Integrity is a broad term that refers to the maintenance and assurance of data quality. This includes the accuracy and consistency of data over its entire lifecycle. Data Integrity is an important part of the design, implementation, and use of any data system that stores, processes, or retrieves information. The term is broad in scope and may have widely different meanings depending on the specific context

Data LossPrevention (DLP)
Data Loss Prevention (DLP) is an umbrella term for a collection of security tools, processes, and procedures that aim to prevent sensitive data from falling into unauthorized or malicious hands. DLP aims at preventing such occurrences through various techniques such as strict access controls on resources, blocking or monitoring email attachments, preventing network file exchange to external systems, blocking cut-and-paste, disabling the use of social networks and encrypting stored data.

Data Theft
Data Theft is the deliberate theft of sensitive data by nefarious actors.

DDoS
A Denial of Service (DoS) or Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is when one or more compromised systems launch a flooding attack on a remote target(s), in an attempt to overload network resources and disrupt service. Some DDoS attacks have caused prolonged, complete service shutdowns of major online operators. Learn more about DDoS attack types.

Decryption
Decryption is the process of decoding cipher text to plain text so that it is readable by humans. It is the reverse of encryption, the process of converting plain text to cipher text. Cybercriminals use decryption software and techniques to ‘break’ security encryption and gain access to protected information.

Domain Name Systems (DNS) Exfiltration
Domain Name System (DNS) Exfiltration is a lower-level attack on DNS servers to gain unauthorized access. Such attacks are difficult to detect and can lead to loss of data. Read more on Allot’s DNS solutions.

Drive-By Download Attack
Drive-by Downloads or attacks are a common method of spreading malware. Cybercriminals look for insecure websites and plant a malicious script into HTTP or PHP code on one of the pages. This script may install malware directly onto the computer of someone who visits the site, or it may take the form of an IFRAME that re-directs the victim to a site controlled by the cybercriminals. Such attacks are called ‘drive-by downloads’ because they require no action on the part of the victim — beyond simply visiting the compromised website: they have infected automatically (and silently) if their computer is vulnerable in some way (e.g., if they have failed to apply a security update to one of their applications).

Encryption
Encryption is a process of maintaining data confidentiality by converting plain data into secret code with the help of an encryption algorithm. Only users with the appropriate decryption key can unscramble and access encrypted data or cipher text.

Endpoint Protection
Endpoint Protection refers to a system for network security management that monitors network endpoints, hardware devices such as workstations and mobile devices from which a network is accessed. Read more on Allot’s Endpoint Protection solutions.

Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)
Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) are tools for protecting computer endpoints from potential threats. EDR platforms comprise software and networking tools for detecting suspicious endpoint activities, usually via continuous network monitoring.

Fast Identity Online (FIDO)
Fast Identity Online (FIDO) is a set of open authentication standards that enable a service provider to leverage existing technologies for passwordless authentication.

Fileless Malware
Fileless Malware (FM), aka “non-malware,” or “fileless infection,” is a form of malicious computer attack that exists exclusively within the realm of volatile data storage components such as RAM, in memory processes, and service areas. This differentiates this form of malware from the classic memory-resident virus which requires some contact with non-volatile storage media, such as a hard disk drive or a thumb drive. Normally picked up following visits to malicious websites, fileless malware does not exist as a file that can be detected by standard antivirus programs. It lurks within a computer’s working memory and is exceptionally difficult to identify. However, this type of malware rarely survives a computer reboot, after which the computer should work as it did prior to infection.

Firewall
A Firewall is a security system that forms a virtual perimeter around a network of workstations preventing viruses, worms, and hackers from penetrating.

Greylist
A Greylist contains items that are temporarily blocked (or temporarily allowed) until an additional step is performed.

Hacker
A Hacker is a term commonly used to describe a person who tries to gain unauthorized access to a network or computer system.

Honeypot
Honeypots are computer security programs that simulate network resources that hackers are likely to look for to lure them in and trap them. An attacker may assume that you’re running weak services that can be used to break into the machine. A honeypot provides you with advanced warning of a more concerted attack. Two or more honeypots on a network form a honeynet.

Identity and Access Management (IAM)
Identity and Access Management (IAM) is the process used by an organization to grant or deny access to a secure system. IAM is an integration of workflow systems that involves organizational think tanks that analyze and make security systems work effectively.

Identity
Theft Identity Theft occurs when a malicious actor gathers enough personal information from the victim (name, address, date of birth, etc.) to enable him to commit identity fraud – i.e., the use of stolen credentials to obtain goods or services by deception. Stolen data can be used to create a new account in the victim’s name (e.g., a bank account), to take over an existing account held by the victim (e.g., a social network account), or to masquerade as the victim while carrying out criminal activities.

Indicators of Compromise (IOC)
Indicators of Compromise (IoC) are bits of forensic data from system log entries or files that identify potentially malicious activity on a system or network. Indicators of Compromise aid information security and IT professionals in detecting data breaches, malware infections, or other threat activity.

Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)
An Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) is a network security system designed to prevent network penetration by malicious actors.

IoT
The term Internet of Things (IoT) is used to describe everyday objects that are connected to the internet and are able to collect and transfer data automatically, without the need for human interaction. The Internet of Things encompasses any physical object (not just traditional computers) that can be assigned an IP address and can transfer data: this includes household appliances, utility meters, cars, CCTV cameras, and even people (e.g., heart implants). Read more about solutions for IoT Security.

Keylogger
A Keylogger is a kind of spyware software that records every keystroke made on a computer’s keyboard. It can record everything a user types including instant messages, email, usernames, and passwords.

Malvertising
Malvertising is the use of online ads to distribute malicious programs. Cybercriminals embed a special script in a banner, or redirect users who click on an ad to a special page containing code for downloading malware. Special methods are used to bypass large ad network filters and place malicious content on trusted sites. In some cases, visitors do not even need to click on a fake ad — the code executes when the ad is displayed.

Malware
Malware is a general term for any type of intrusive computer software with malicious intent against the user.

Man-in-the Middle Attack
A man-in-the-middle attack (MITM) is an attack where the attacker secretly relays and possibly alters the communications between two parties who believe they are directly communicating with each other. For example, a victim believes he’s connected to his bank’s website and the flow of traffic to and from the real bank site remains unchanged, so the victim sees nothing suspicious. However, the traffic is redirected through the attacker’s site, allowing the attacker to gather any personal data entered by the victim (login, password, PIN, etc.).

MITRE ATT&CK™ Framework
The MITRE ATT&CK™ framework is a comprehensive matrix of tactics and techniques used by threat hunters, red teamers, and defenders to better classify attacks and assess an organization’s risk. The aim of the framework is to improve post-compromise detection of adversaries in enterprises by illustrating the actions an attacker may have taken.

Network-based (cyber) Security
Mass-market cybersecurity services (e.g., anti-malware, anti-phishing) that operate from within a CSP’s network and not at the endpoint, such as a PC or a mobile device. Network-based services can protect any connected device regardless of model or operating system. This type of service, however, cannot be bypassed like other cybersecurity solutions and they can be implemented with no software installation, upgrades or configuration required on the part of the end user, leading to high rates of service adoption. Read more on solutions for Network Security.

Parental Controls
Parental Controls are features which may be included in digital television services, computer and video games, mobile devices, and software that allow parents to restrict the access of content to their children. These controls were created to help parents control which types of content can be viewed by their children.

Patch
A Patch provides additional, revised or updated code for an operating system or application. Except for open source software, most software vendors do not publish their source code. So, patches are typically pieces of binary code that are patched into an existing program (using an install program).

Pen Testing
Pen (Penetration) Testing is the practice of intentionally challenging the security of a computer system, network, or web application to discover vulnerabilities that an attacker or hacker could exploit.

Phishing
Phishing is a type of internet fraud that seeks to acquire a user’s credentials by deception. It includes the theft of passwords, credit card numbers, bank account details, and other confidential information. Phishing messages usually take the form of fake notifications from banks, providers, e-pay systems, and other organizations. The phishing attempt will try to encourage a recipient, for one reason or another, to enter/update personal data. Common reasons given can include “suspicious login to the account,” or “expiration of the password.”

PII
Personal Identifiable Information (PII or PII) is a type of data that identifies the unique identity of an individual.

Process Hollowing
Process Hollowing is a security exploit in which an attacker removes code in an executable file and replaces it with malicious code. The process hollowing attack is used by hackers to cause an otherwise legitimate process to execute malicious code. This attack can be done while evading potential defenses, such as detection analysis software.

Ransomware
Ransomware is the name given to malicious programs designed to extort money from victims by blocking access to the computer or encrypting stored data. The malware displays a message offering to restore the system/data in return for payment. Sometimes, cybercriminals behind the scam try to lend credibility to their operation by masquerading as law enforcement officials. Their ransom message asserts that the system has been blocked, or the data encrypted, because the victim is running unlicensed software or has accessed illegal content, and that the victim must pay a fine. Read more on Allot’s solutions for Business Security.

Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)
RDP is a protocol for remotely connecting to computers running Windows. It enables interaction with desktop elements as well as access to other device resources. RDP was conceived as a remote administration tool. However, it is often used by intruders to penetrate targeted computers. By exploiting incorrectly configured RDP settings or system software vulnerabilities, cybercriminals can intercept an RDP session and log into the system with the victim’s permissions.

Risktool
Risktool programs have various functions, such as concealing files in the system, hiding the windows of running applications, or terminating active processes. They are not malicious in themselves, but include cryptocurrency miners that generate coins using the target device’s resources. Cybercriminals usually use them in stealth mode. Unlike NetTool, such programs are designed to operate locally.

Rootkit
A Rootkit is a collection of software tools or a program that gives a hacker remote access to, and control over, a computer or network. Rootkits themselves do not cause direct harm – and there have been legitimate uses for this type of software, such as to provide remote end user support. However, most rootkits open a backdoor on targeted computers for the introduction of malware, viruses, and ransomware, or use the system for further network security attacks. A rootkit is typically installed through a stolen password, or by exploiting system vulnerabilities without the victim’s knowledge. In most cases, rootkits are used in conjunction with other malware to prevent detection by endpoint antivirus software.

Sandbox(ing)
In cybersecurity, a sandbox is an isolated environment on a network that mimics end-user operating environments. Sandboxes are used to safely execute suspicious code without risking harm to the host device or network.

Scareware
Scareware is malware that uses scare tactics, often in the form of pop-ups that falsely warn users they have been infected with a virus, to trick users into visiting malware-containing websites.

SECaaS
Security as a Service (SECaaS) is a type of cloud computing service where the provider offers the customer the ability to use a provided application. Examples of a SECaaS include online e-mail services or online document editing systems. A user of a SECaaS solution is only able to use the offered application and make minor configuration tweaks. The SECaaS provider is responsible for maintaining the application. Allot Secure is the first solution to offer SECaaS en mass to network service subscribers. Read more on Allot’s solutions for Network Security.

SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)
Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) is a formal process by which the security of an organization is monitored and evaluated on a constant basis. SIEM helps to automatically identify systems that are out of compliance with the security policy as well as to notify the IRT (Incident Response Team) of any security-violating events.

SIM Swapping
SIM Swapping is a scam used to intercept online banking SMS verification codes. To get hold of one-time passwords for financial transactions, cybercriminals create or fraudulently obtain a copy of the victim’s SIM card — for example, pretending to be the victim, the attacker might claim to have lost the SIM card and request a new one from the mobile operator. To protect clients from such schemes, most banks require that a replacement SIM card be re-linked to the account.

Sniffing
Packet sniffing allows the capture of data as it is being transmitted over a network. Packet sniffer programs are used by network professionals to diagnose network issues. Malicious actors can use sniffers to capture unencrypted data like passwords and usernames in network traffic. Once this information is captured, the bad actor can then gain access to the system or network.

SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation and Response)
SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation and Response) is a solution stack of compatible software programs that organizations use to collect data about security threats from across the network and respond to low-level security events without human assistance.

Social Engineering
Social Engineering is an increasingly popular method of gaining access to unauthorized resources by exploiting human psychology and manipulating users – rather than by breaking in or using technical hacking techniques. Instead of trying to find a software vulnerability in a corporate system, a social engineer might send an email to an employee pretending to be from the IT department, trying to trick him into revealing sensitive information. Social engineering is the foundation of spear phishing attacks.

Spam
Spam is the name commonly given to unsolicited emails. Essentially unwanted advertising, it’s the email equivalent of physical junk mail delivered through the post.

Spear Phishing
Spear Phishing is a phishing scam that targets a specific individual or organization, usually via a personalized email, SMS or other electronic communication to defraud them under the guise of a legitimate transaction.

Spoofing
A Spoof is an attack attempt by an unauthorized entity or attacker to gain illegitimate access to a system by posing as an authorized user. Spoofing includes any act of disguising a communication from an unknown source as being from a known, trusted source. Spoofing can apply to emails, phone calls, and websites, or can be more technical, such as a computer spoofing an IP address.

Spyware
Spyware is software that is secretly installed on a user’s device to gather sensitive data. Spyware quietly collects information such as credentials and sends it outside the network to bad actors. Spyware often comes in the form of a free download and is installed automatically, with or without user consent.

Threat Assessment
Threat Assessment is a structured process used to identify and evaluate various risks or threats that an organization might be exposed to. Cyber threat assessment is a crucial part of any organization’s risk management strategy and data protection efforts.

Threat Hunting
Cyber Threat Hunting is an active cyber defense activity where cybersecurity professionals actively search networks to detect and mitigate advanced threats that evade existing security solutions.

Threat Intelligence
Threat Intelligence, or cyber threat intelligence, is intelligence proactively obtained and used to understand the threats that are targeting the organization. Trojan Trojans are malicious programs that perform actions that are not authorized by the user: they delete, block, modify or copy data, and they disrupt the performance of computers or computer networks. Unlike viruses and worms, Trojans are unable to make copies of themselves or self-replicate. Read more about Threat Intelligence Solutions.

Two-factor Authentification (2FA)
Two-factor Authentification combines a static password with an external authentication device such as a hardware token that generates a randomly-generated one-time password, a smart card, an SMS message (where a mobile phone is the token), or a unique physical attribute like a fingerprint.

Two-step Authentification
Two-step Authentification is commonly used on websites and is an improvement over single factor authentication. This form of authentication requires the visitor to provide their username (i.e. claim an identity) and password (i.e. the single factor authentication) before performing an additional step. The additional step could be receiving a text message with a code, then typing that code back into the website for confirmation. Alternatives include receiving an email and needing to click on a link in the message for confirmation, or viewing a pre-selected image and statement before typing in another password or PIN.

Virus
A Virus is a malicious computer program that is often sent as an email attachment or a download with the intent of infecting that device. Once the device is infected, a virus can hijack the web browser, display unwanted ads, send spam, provide criminals with access to the device and contact list, disable security settings, scan, and find personal information like passwords.

VPN
A Virtual Private Network (VPN) extends a private network across a public network and enables users to send and receive data across shared or public networks as if their computing devices were directly connected to the private network. It is essentially a virtual, secure corridor.

Vulnerability
Vulnerabilities are weaknesses in software programs that can be exploited by hackers to compromise computers.

WAF
A Web Application Firewall (WAF) is a specific form of application firewall that filters, monitors, and blocks HTTP traffic to and from a web service. By inspecting HTTP traffic, it can prevent attacks exploiting a web application’s known vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), file inclusion, and improper system configuration.

White Hat – Black Hat
White hat – Black Hat are terms to describe the ‘good guys’ and ‘bad guys’ in the world of cybercrime. Blackhats are hackers with criminal intentions. White-hats are hackers who use their skills and talents for good and work to keep data safe from other hackers by finding system vulnerabilities that can be fixed.

Whitelist, Allowlist
A Whitelist, allowlist, passlist is a list of permitted items that are automatically let through whatever gate is being used. Worm A Worm is a computer program that installs itself on a victim’s device and then looks for a way to spread to other computers, causing damage by shutting down parts of the network. Read more on Allot’s solutions for Whitelist/Allowlist.

Zero-day Exploit
This term is used to describe exploit code that has been written to take advantage of a vulnerability before the software vendor knows about it and can publish a patch for it. The result is that would-be attackers are free to exploit the vulnerability, unless proactive exploit prevention technologies have been implemented to defend the computer being targeted by the attacker.

Zero-touch Provisioning or Deployment
Zero-Touch Provisioning (ZTP) is an automatic device configuration process that frees IT administrators for more important tasks. The automated process reduces the possibility of errors when manually configuring devices and slashes the time it takes to set up devices for employee use, often without requiring IT intervention. Users can set up their devices with a few clicks, eliminating the need for administrators to create and track system images or manage the infrastructure required to push those images to new or repurposed devices. Read more on Allot’s solutions for Zero-touch provisioning.
