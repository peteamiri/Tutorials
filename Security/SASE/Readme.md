## Business Drivers
Enterprise security is no loneger a technical issue that is dealth with by within the relam of the data centers. ENterprise security is one of the major concenrs of the user communites and the organzational managment including the C-Suites. Balancing the growth and security in a cost effective way has been a major challenge that most organzations has been facing.

Organizations seek to accelerate growth and use more eficient and cost effective resources offered through the cloud technology, increased volume and accelarated generaion of the data, users accessiblity, variey of the devices devices, neumerous applications, and services are used impose the significant challenge to the enterprise. Thraditional approach no longer can responds to the organiational needs.

`static network parameters` vs `dynamic network parameters`

it is a set of dynamic edge capabilities delivered when needed as a service from the cloud.


* increasingly distributed workforce,
* increased globalization and Disribution of the business,
* apps and data is moving to the cloud.

This opens up a host of new opportunities, but so much fundamental change also creates new avenues for cybersecurity risk. It’s time to rethink how network security is delivered.




This new dynamic perimeter changes the way organizations must approach security and risk management. It adds complexity – more environments, disparate products, and a shortage of skilled staff to manage it all. Environmental coverage, including visibility and control, can be easily lost when users, devices, and data are created and stored virtually everywhere.

SASE converges networking and network security into a single, cloud-delivered offering to support the needs of digital business transformation, edge computing, and workforce mobility. Gartner’s SASE framework provides for the dynamic creation of a policy-based, secure-access service edge, regardless of the location of the entities requesting the capabilities, and regardless of the location of the networked capabilities they are requesting access to.

# SASE
 Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) is a security framework for enabling secure and fast cloud adoption, and helping ensure both users and devices have secure cloud access to applications, data and services anywhere, any time.

Existing network approaches and technologies no longer provide the levels of security and access control digital organizations need. These organizations demand immediate, uninterrupted access for their users, no matter where they are located.


With an increase in remote users and software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications, data moving from the data center to cloud services, and more traffic going to public cloud services and branch offices than back to the data center, the need for a new approach for network security has risen.



## Capablities
SASE core capablities are:
* SD-WAN
* SWG
* CASB
* ZTNA
* FWaaS

with continuous monitoring of sessions for risk and trust levels.
