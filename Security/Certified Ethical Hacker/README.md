# Certified Ethical Hacker

CEH stands for Certified Ethical Hacker and is a certification program offered by the EC-Council. The certification covers a wide range of topics related to ethical hacking and cybersecurity.


## Tools for CEH

The tools used in CEH may vary depending on the specific version of the program being studied or the particular areas of focus within the program. However, some commonly used CEH tools include

* Nessus,
* Nmap,
* Wireshark,
* Metasploit,
* Aircrack-ng,
* John the Ripper,
* Tcpdump,
* Maltego.

Other tools that might be used in CEH include

* Acunetix,
* Burp Suite,
* Nikto


## OPEN SOURCE RESEARCH/FOOTPRINTING TOOLS

Footprinting, also know as reconnaissance, refers to the act of gathering information to aid a hacker in their attack. A hacker may research into the specific systems used or even details pertaining to the organization and its employees that could be used in a social engineering attack. Often times black and white hat hackers prefer to use open source, or free and widely available, tools because they can be altered easily to fit their unique needs without having to write entire applications from scratch.

Here are a few of the open source research and footprinting tools that may appear on the CEH certification exam:

* Maltego
* Recon-NG
* FOCA
* OSR Framework
* Recon-Dog
* BillCipher
* cewl
* metagoofil
* Censys

## SCANNING TOOLS
After the reconnaissance phase, hackers will build upon the information they gathered by performing three types of scans: a port scan, vulnerability scan and network scan. These scans are used to identify the number of open ports, known vulnerabilities and IP addresses.

Here are a few of the scanning tools that may appear on the CEH certification exam:

* nmap
* hping2/3
* Metasploit
* NetScanTools Pro
* Zenmap

## PROXY TOOLS
A proxy server is a hardware or software system that serves as an intermediary between the end-user and their online destination such as a website or cloud-based app. A proxy server offers a level of anonymity for your online activity.

Here are a few of the proxy tools that may appear on the CEH certification exam:

* BurpSuite
* Tor
* Proxy Switcher
* CyberGhost VPN
* Tails
* Whonix

## ENUMERATION TOOLS
Enumeration is the process of extracting a system’s machine names, services, network resources, user names and other valuable data to be used to exploit a system. During this phase, a hacker will connect to the target system and then perform direct actions to obtain more detailed information about the target which will then be used to determine the system’s weak point or vulnerabilities.

Here are a few of the enumeration tools that may appear on the CEH certification exam:

* SNMP
* MIB
* LDAP
* NFS
* Dig

## VULNERABILITY ANALYSIS TOOLS
Once you have identified a system’s weak points during the enumeration phase, a vulnerability analysis will dive deeper into each of those cybersecurity flaws and determine their severity to prioritize fixes.

Here are a few of the tools that can be used in a vulnerability analysis and may appear on the CEH certification exam:

* CVSS/NVD/CVE/CWE
* Nessus
* GFI LanGuard
* OpenVas
* Nikto
* Qualsys
* Saint
* Network Security Scanner

## EXPLOITATION TOOLS

An exploit is an attack on the vulnerabilities found within a system. These vulnerabilities may be through the system’s hardware, operating systems, applications, or networks and exploits will usually be performed through various programming efforts in order to take control of the system or export valuable data.

Here are a few of the tools that can be used to exploit a system and may appear on the CEH certification exam:

* John the Ripper
* Mimikatz
* Hashcat
* pwdump
* L0phtCrack
* PsExec
* LoJax
* Scranos

## ANTI-ROOTKIT TOOLS

An anti rootkit helps identify malicious administrative access to a system usually gained through suspect processes, registry keys, hooks or modules, modified files, and rootkits.

Here are a few of the anti-rootkit tools that may appear on the CEH certification exam:

* Stinger
* Rootkit Buster
* Malwarebytes Anti-Rootkit

## MALWARE/TROJAN GENERATORS

A malware or trojan generator allows a hacker to quickly create their own malicious tools that can be used to attack a system.

Here are a few of the malware and trojan generators that may appear on the CEH certification exam:

* DarkHorse
* Angler
* Divergent
* Vaporworm
* NLBrute
* Powershell

### Types of Hacking

* Website Hacking: Hacking a website means taking unauthorized control over a web server and its associated software such as databases and other interfaces.

* Network Hacking: Hacking a network means gathering information about a network by using tools like Telnet, NS lookup, Ping, Tracert, Netstat, etc. with the intent to harm the network system and hamper its operation.

* Email Hacking: It includes getting unauthorized access on an Email account and using it without taking the consent of its owner.

* Ethical Hacking: Ethical hacking involves finding weaknesses in a computer or etwork system for testing purpose and finally getting them fixed.

* Password Hacking: This is the process of recovering secret passwords from data that has been stored in or transmitted by a computer system.

* Computer Hacking: This is the process of stealing computer ID and password by applying hacking methods and getting unauthorized access to a computer system.

### Types of Hackers

* `White Hat Hackers` : are also known as `Ethical Hackers`. They never intent to harm a system, rather they try to find out weaknesses in a computer or a network system as a part of penetration testing and vulnerability assessments. Ethical hacking is not illegal and it is one of the demanding jobs available in the IT industry. There are numerous companies that hire ethical hackers for penetration testing and vulnerability assessments.

* `Black Hat Hackers` : also known as `crackers`, are those who hack in order to gain unauthorized access to a system and harm its operations or steal sensitive information. Black Hat hacking is always illegal because of its bad intent which includes stealing corporate data, violating privacy, damaging the system, blocking network communication,
etc.

* `Grey Hat Hackers` : are a blend of both black hat and white hat hackers. They act without malicious intent but for their fun, they exploit a security weakness in a computer system or network without the owner’s permission or knowledge. Their intent is to bring the weakness to the attention of the owners and getting appreciation or a little bounty from the owners.

* `Miscellaneous Hackers` : Apart from the above well-known classes of hackers, we have the following categories of
hackers based on what they hack and how they do it:
  - `Red Hat Hackers` : Red hat hackers are again a blend of both black hat and white hat hackers. They are usually on the level of hacking government agencies, top-secret information hubs, and generally anything that falls under the category of sensitive information.
  - `Blue Hat Hackers` : A blue hat hacker is someone outside computer security consulting firms who is used to bug-test a system prior to its launch. They look for loopholes that can be exploited and try to close these gaps. Microsoft also uses the term BlueHat to represent a series of security briefing events.
  - `Elite Hackers` : This is a social status among hackers, which is used to describe the most skilled. Newly discovered exploits will circulate among these hackers.
  - `Script Kiddie` : A script kiddie is a non-expert who breaks into computer systems by using pre-packaged automated tools written by others, usually with little understanding of the underlying concept, hence the term Kiddie.
  - `Neophyte`: also know as "n00b", or "newbie" or "Green Hat Hacker" is someone who is new to hacking or phreaking and has almost no knowledge or experience of the workings of technology and hacking.
  - `Hacktivist` : is a hacker who utilizes technology to announce a social, ideological, religious, or political message. In general, most hacktivism involves website defacement or denial-of-service attacks.

### Methodology
An ethical hacking methodology is quite similar to a hacking methodology as there are more or less the same goals. Anyhow, some differences exist. An ethical hacker doesn’t need to take that much care in hiding his traces and tracks. He can chose a more aggressive way and doesn’t need to bother with slowing down portscans (to avoid detection) or evading intrusion detection systems – at least most of the time unless it is specially desired by the client. Mostly, an ethical hacker just hasn’t the time to be that careful in blurring his traces and tracks unless the customer pays for. Nevertheless, a lot of similarities can be found to a hacking methodology. An ethical hacking methodology overview can be seen in figure 2. A similar setup could be used by a hacker for his attacks. The ethical hacking methodology described is based on eight possible phases where interactions between the phases are possible, even required as hacking is an iterative process; going back to an earlier phase is absolutely
possible (and needed).

1. Reconnaissance: It refers to gather as more information as we can about target in prior to perform an attack. It can be further classified into Active and Passive. Former involves information gathering with direct interaction like social engineering and the later without any direct interaction by searching news release or public records.

2. Scanning: It refers to scan for all the open as well as closed ports and even for the known vulnerabilities on the target machine.
* Passive scanning  Gather as much information about the target as possible while maintaining zero contact between the penetration tester and the target. Passive scanning, otherwise known as Open Source Intelligence (OSINT), can include
  - Social networking sites
  - Online databases
  - Google, Monster.com, etc.
  - Dumpster diving
* Active scanning and enumeration  Probe the target’s public exposure with scanning tools, which might include
  - Commercial scanning tools
  - Network mapping
  - Banner grabbing
  - War dialing
  - DNS zone transfers
  - Sniffing traffic
  - Wireless war driving
* Fingerprinting  Perform a thorough probe of the target systems to identify
   - Operating system type and patch level
   - Applications and patch level
   - Open ports
   - Running services
   - User accounts
* Selecting target system  Identify the most useful target(s).
* Exploiting the uncovered vulnerabilities  Execute the appropriate attack tools targeted at the suspected exposures.
   - Some may not work.
   - Some may kill services or even kill the server.
   - Some may be successful.
* Escalating privilege  Escalate the security context so the ethical hacker has more control.
   - Gaining root or administrative rights
   - Using cracked password for unauthorized access
   - Carrying out buffer overflow to gain local versus remote control
* Documenting and reporting  Document everything found, how it was found, the tools that were used, vulnerabilities that were exploited, the timeline of activities and successes, and so on.

3. Gaining Control: It can be gained at OS level, system level or even network level. From normal access hacker can even proceed with privilege escalation. It often includes password cracking, buffer overflows, DoS attack etc.

4. Maintaining Access: It is where hacker strives to retain its control over target with backdoors, root kits or Trojans. Compromised machines can even be used as Bots and Zombies for further attacks.

5. Covering Tracks : It is also known as Daisy Chaining. To avoid being exposed or caught, a good hacker will leave no impressions of his presence. So he attempts to overwrite the system and application logs.

## What Would an Unethical Hacker Do Differently?
1.	Target selection
* Motivated by a grudge or for fun or profit.
* There are no ground rules, no hands-off targets, and the security team is definitely blind to the upcoming attack.

2.	Intermediaries
* The attacker launches his attack from a different system (intermediary) than his own, or a series of other systems, to make it more difficult to track back to him in case the attack is detected.
* Intermediaries are often victims of the attacker as well.

3. Penetration testing steps described in the previous section
* Scanning
* Footprinting
* Selecting target system
* Fingerprinting
* Exploiting the uncovered vulnerabilities
* Escalating privilege

4.	Preserving access
* This involves uploading and installing a rootkit, backdoor, Trojaned applications, and/or bots to assure that the attacker can regain access at a later time.

5.	Covering tracks
* Scrubbing event and audit logs
* Hiding uploaded files
* Hiding the active processes that allow the attacker to regain access
* Disabling messages to security software and system logs to hide malicious processes and actions

6.	Hardening the system
* After taking ownership of a system, an attacker may fix the open vulnerabilities so no other attacker can use the system for other purposes.

How the attacker uses the compromised system depends on what his or her over-all goals are, which could include stealing sensitive information, redirecting financial transactions, adding the systems to his or her bot network, extorting a company, and so on. The crux is that ethical and unethical hackers carry out basically the same activities only with different intentions. If the ethical hacker does not identify the hole in the defenses first, the unethical hacker will surely slip in and make himself at home.


### HACKING TOOLS
There are various characteristics for the use of tools for ethical hacking which are as follows:

1. Adequate documentation
2. Detailed reports on the discovered vulnerabilities, including how they can be fixed
3. Updates and support when needed
4. High level reports that can be presented to managers .

The list and description of various tools used in the ethical hacking process are as follows:
