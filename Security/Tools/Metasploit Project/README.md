# Metasploit Project

Metasploit is an opensource, robust, modular, and flexible penetration testing framework , written in Ruby. 
It consist of a number of tools used to test network security and discover vulnerabilities. 
It facilitate creation, testing, and execution of exploit code with neumerous tools to perform various simple and complex tasks. 

## Metasploit Components

* Auxiliaries: are pieces of code written to perform a particular task. Metasploit has more than 1,000 auxiliary modules to tasks like scanning, 
fuzzing, sniffing, and much more. These auxiliary modules are classified into 19 categories. 

* Payloads: can be defined as the action that needs to be performed after the complete execution of an exploit. Metasploit has around 42 payloads that can be classified into the following categories:
	* Command shell enables users to run collection scripts or run arbitrary commands against the host.
	* Meterpreter (the Metasploit Interpreter) enables users to control the screen of a device using VNC and to browse, upload and download files.
	* Dynamic payloads enable users to evade anti-virus defense by generating unique payloads.
	* Static payloads enable static IP address/port forwarding for communication between the host and the client system.

	* Exploits: is a piece of software, a chunk of data, or a sequence of commands that takes advantage of a vulnerability or security flaw. 
Metasploit has more than 1,800 exploits that can be classified into 17 categories.   

* Encoders: use various algorithms and techniques to obscure the payload in a way that it doesnâ€™t get detected. 
Metasploit has about 40 encoders. 

* Post-Exploitation Activities (Post): Metasploit has around 300 post-exploitation modules that can be classified into 11 categories. They facilitates the following Post-exploitation activities :

	* Escalating user privileges to administrator or root.
	* Retrieving the system credentials
	* Stealing cookies and saved credentials
	* Capturing keystrokes on the target system
	* Executing custom Power Shell scripts for performing
	* Additional tasks: Making the Access persistent
