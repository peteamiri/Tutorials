## IT Security Standard organization

* International Organization for Standardization (ISO): ISO is a non-governmental organization that develops and publishes international standards for various industries, including information security. The most well-known information security standard from ISO is ISO/IEC 27001, which provides a framework for establishing, implementing, maintaining, and continually improving an information security management system (ISMS).

* National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST): NIST is a research and development organization under the U.S. Department of Commerce that publishes standards, guidelines, and best practices for various fields, including information security. Some of the well-known information security standards from NIST include the NIST Cybersecurity Framework and the NIST Special Publication 800 series, which provides guidelines for information security management and risk assessment.

* Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council (PCI SSC): The PCI SSC is a global organization that develops and maintains security standards for the payment card industry. The most well-known standard from the PCI SSC is the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), which provides a set of requirements for protecting cardholder data.

* Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF): The IETF is a community-driven organization that develops and promotes internet standards, including security-related standards. Some of the well-known security-related standards from the IETF include the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol and the Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC).

* Cloud Security Alliance (CSA): provides guidance on cloud security,

* Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP), which provides guidance on web application security.

There are also other organizations and bodies that publish security standards, such as the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) and the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP), among others.
