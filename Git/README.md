# GITHUB #

GitHub is an online platform for version control and collaboration that is widely used by developers and software engineers. It allows users to store their code in repositories, which can be shared with others and worked on collaboratively.

GitHub was originally founded in 2008 and has since become one of the most popular platforms for open-source software development. It provides a variety of features such as issue tracking, pull requests, and code reviews, which make it easier for developers to work together on projects and ensure that code changes are properly reviewed and tested before being merged into the codebase.

In addition to hosting code repositories, GitHub also provides tools for continuous integration and deployment, as well as a marketplace where developers can find and use various software development tools and services. The platform is owned by Microsoft, which acquired GitHub in 2018.

## GITHUB Markdown

GitHub Markdown is a lightweight markup language that is used to format text on the GitHub platform. It is a simplified version of HTML that is designed to be easy to read and write, while still allowing for rich formatting options.

GitHub Markdown is used for writing README files, documentation, and other text-based content on the platform. It supports basic formatting options like bold and italic text, headings, and lists, as well as more advanced features like code blocks, tables, and links.

One of the benefits of using GitHub Markdown is that it can be rendered in a variety of formats, including HTML and PDF, making it easy to create documentation that can be viewed across multiple platforms and devices.

GitHub Markdown is also highly customizable, allowing users to add custom CSS styles to their documents to create a unique look and feel. Additionally, GitHub provides a set of extensions and plugins that can be used to further extend the functionality of Markdown on the platform.
