# IT Governance

IT governance refers to the process of managing, monitoring, and controlling the use of information technology (IT) within an organization. It involves the establishment of policies, procedures, and guidelines to ensure that IT systems and processes are aligned with the goals and objectives of the organization, and that they support the organization's overall strategy.

The primary goals of IT governance are to ensure that IT investments are aligned with business objectives, to minimize risks associated with the use of IT, and to ensure that IT resources are used efficiently and effectively. IT governance typically involves the creation of a framework of policies, standards, and procedures that guide the use and management of IT assets and resources.

Some of the key components of an IT governance framework include:

* strategy and planning
* portfolio management
* risk management
* performance management
* compliance management
* security and data protection

governance is typically overseen by a dedicated IT governance committee or board, which is responsible for ensuring that IT activities are aligned with the organization's overall objectives, and that they are being carried out in an effective and efficient manner.
