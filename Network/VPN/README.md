# Virtual Private Network 

Virtual Private Network (VPN) encrypts the network traffic to protect the online identity, hide IP address, and protect the transient daya. 
VPN uses real-time encryption and sends the data over a secure virtual tunnel provides data protection and anonymity. 
 
## Protocols of VPN

The followings are VPN Protocols

* Internet Protocol Security (IPSec)
* Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP)
* Point to Pint Tunneling Protocol (PPTP)
* SSTP (Secure Socket Tunneling Protocol)
* Internet Key Exchange version 2 (IKEv2)
* Secure Socces Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS)
* OpenVPN
* Secure Shell (SSH)
* MPLS VPN
* Hybrid VPN

### Internet Protocol Security (IPSec)
 
IPSec is a VPN Protocol that provides secure connection over IP networks. 
With this VPN protocol authentication and encryption are used.
There are different type of IPSec and with this type of IPSec, there are different encryption modes. 
These are Transport Mode and Tunneling Mode. In transfer mode oly the message in the traffic is encrypted. On the other hand, in tunneling mode, whole data is encrypted.
IPSec is a little difficult to build and it is also expensive solution if you compare with other VPN solutions.

### Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP)
 
Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) is another VPN protocol that is widely used in network World. 
At the beginning it has many vulnerabilities but after a while it is used with IPSec. IPSec provides extra security to L2TP.  
Here, the tunnel creation is done by L2TP and the encryptions is done by IPSec.

### Point to Pint Tunneling Protocol (PPTP)
 
PPTP is a widely used  tunnelling protocol that uses Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) to encrypt the data through the tunnel. 
PPTP is a fast protocol if you compare with other tunneling protocols. 
But it has some vulnerabilities. Over the years, network attacks has increased and this VPN vulnerabilities become important gap. 
So, even it is a widely used VPN protocol, PPTP is not as secure as other tunneling protocols. 

### SSTP
 
SSTP (Secure Socket Tunneling Protocol) is a VPN solution that came with Windows build in solution for VPN. 
It is similar to Open VPN but instead of an open solution, it is used on mainly Windows. 
So, it is not a widely prefered VPN protocol.
Because of the fact that it has developed for Windows, now, it is not used on Linux widely and can not used on Macs.
The security of SSTP (Secure Socket Tunneling Protocol) is like Open VPN but fort his, you shoould trus Windows a little.

### IKEv2
 
Internet Key Exchange version 2 (IKEv2), was developed by Cisco and Microsoft. 
In real, it is not a VPN protocol. It is used especially for mobile device connections.
IKEv2 is a fast and secure protocol. It uses various encryption mechanism like AES, IPSec etc.
