The TOGAF Standard is an architecture framework that provides methods and tools for assisting in the acceptance , production, use, and maintenance of an enterprise architecture.

TOGAF is based on a set of principles and best practices that are used to develop and manage an enterprise architecture. The framework is divided into four main components: the Architecture Development Method (ADM), the Architecture Content Framework, the Architecture Capability Framework, and the Architecture Governance Framework.

* The ADM is a step-by-step process for developing an enterprise architecture. It includes phases for developing a vision, defining architecture requirements, creating a baseline architecture, developing a target architecture, and implementing and monitoring the architecture.

* The Architecture Content Framework provides a set of tools and techniques for developing and managing the content of an enterprise architecture. This includes templates for architecture artifacts, such as models, diagrams, and specifications.

* The Architecture Capability Framework describes the organizational structures, roles, and responsibilities needed to support the development and implementation of an enterprise architecture.

* The Architecture Governance Framework provides a set of policies, procedures, and guidelines for managing the enterprise architecture process and ensuring that it aligns with the organization's business goals and objectives.

TOGAF is a flexible and adaptable framework that can be customized to meet the needs of different organizations. It provides a common language and framework for communication between different stakeholders and helps to ensure that the organization's IT architecture is aligned with its overall business strategy.
