#Computer Vision

Computer vision is an interdisciplinary field of study that involves the development of algorithms and techniques to enable computers to interpret and understand digital images and videos. It is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), and draws upon knowledge from a range of other fields such as mathematics, physics, statistics, and neuroscience.

The goal of computer vision is to enable machines to perceive and understand the visual world in the same way that humans do, and to use this understanding to make decisions, perform tasks, and interact with their environment. Computer vision has a wide range of applications, including object recognition, facial recognition, autonomous vehicles, medical imaging, and surveillance.
