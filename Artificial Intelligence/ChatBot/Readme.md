# Chatbot

A chatbot is a computer program that simulates human conversation , either through text or voice interactions, using artificial intelligence and natural language processing. Chatbots are designed to automate customer-facing interactions, and can be used to enhance customer experience , answer customer queries, lodge service requests, share knowledge, and perform routine tasks in a cost-effective manner. They can be embedded in messaging applications or websites, and can operate via machine learning or with set guidelines .

## Fundamental

The fundamentals of chatbot technology include:
* Understanding user input and intent,
* Processing and analyzing data,
* Providing relevant responses,
* Automating routine tasks.

Additionally, chatbot design should prioritize simplicity and efficiency, with a focus on optimizing the user experience. Other key principles of chatbot design include respecting the chat medium, avoiding pretending to be human, and implementing conversational design principles that facilitate cooperation, goal-orientation, contextual understanding and quick and clear responses. Overall, chatbots are powered by rules engine and artificial intelligence, and they leverage:

* Natural language processing,
* Machine learning,
* Data analytics

to provide smart and efficient conversations with users

## OpenAI
OpenAI is a research and development company that is focused on advancing artificial intelligence technologies and ensuring that AI benefits all of humanity. OpenAI is known for its development of advanced natural language processing models, such as GPT and Codex, which have been used to create sophisticated chatbots and other AI-powered applications. Founded in 2015, OpenAI is a private research laboratory consisting of a non-profit organization and a for-profit subsidiary . Its mission is to create and promote safe AGI (artificial general intelligence), which is AI that has the ability to perform any intellectual task that a human can.

## Natural language processing (NLP)

Based on the search results, natural language processing is a subfield of linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence that focuses on developing algorithms and computational models that enable computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. Natural language processing includes several techniques such as syntactic and semantic analysis, speech recognition, machine translation, text-to-speech conversion, and information retrieval. NLP is used to power various applications such as chatbots, virtual assistants, sentiment analysis, and automatic language translation.

Natural language processing (NLP) refers to the branch of computer science—and more specifically, the branch of artificial intelligence or AI—concerned with giving computers the ability to understand text and spoken words in much the same way human beings can.

NLP combines computational linguistics—rule-based modeling of human language—with statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models. Together, these technologies enable computers to process human language in the form of text or voice data and to ‘understand’ its full meaning, complete with the speaker or writer’s intent and sentiment.

NLP drives computer programs that translate text from one language to another, respond to spoken commands, and summarize large volumes of text rapidly—even in real time. There’s a good chance you’ve interacted with NLP in the form of voice-operated GPS systems, digital assistants, speech-to-text dictation software, customer service chatbots, and other consumer conveniences. But NLP also plays a growing role in enterprise solutions that help streamline business operations, increase employee productivity, and simplify mission-critical business processes.

### How does natural language processing work?

NLP enables computers to understand natural language as humans do. Whether the language is spoken or written, natural language processing uses artificial intelligence to take real-world input, process it, and make sense of it in a way a computer can understand. Just as humans have different sensors -- such as ears to hear and eyes to see -- computers have programs to read and microphones to collect audio. And just as humans have a brain to process that input, computers have a program to process their respective inputs. At some point in processing, the input is converted to code that the computer can understand.

There are two main phases to natural language processing: data preprocessing and algorithm development.

Data preprocessing involves preparing and "cleaning" text data for machines to be able to analyze it. preprocessing puts data in workable form and highlights features in the text that an algorithm can work with. There are several ways this can be done, including:

* Tokenization. This is when text is broken down into smaller units to work with.

* Stop word removal. This is when common words are removed from text so unique words that offer the most information about the text remain.

* Lemmatization and stemming. This is when words are reduced to their root forms to process.

* Part-of-speech tagging. This is when words are marked based on the part-of speech they are -- such as nouns, verbs and adjectives.

Once the data has been preprocessed, an algorithm is developed to process it. There are many different natural language processing algorithms, but two main types are commonly used:

* Rules-based system. This system uses carefully designed linguistic rules. This approach was used early on in the development of natural language processing, and is still used.

* Machine learning-based system. Machine learning algorithms use statistical methods. They learn to perform tasks based on training data they are fed, and adjust their methods as more data is processed. Using a combination of machine learning, deep learning and neural networks, natural language processing algorithms hone their own rules through repeated processing and learning.
