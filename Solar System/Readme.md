# Solar System

Here's a table listing the planets in our solar system in order of their distance from the Sun. It includes the distance from the Sun, the orbital period (time to rotate around the Sun), the size (diameter), the time it takes for light from the Sun to reach the planet (in minutes), the type of planet, the number of moons, and the names of some significant moons for each planet:

Notes:
- Distances are in million kilometers.
- Orbital periods are in Earth days.
- Sizes are in kilometers.
- Light travel time is the time it takes for light from the Sun to reach the planet at its average distance, calculated based on the speed of light in a vacuum (299,792 kilometers per second).
- The type of planet is categorized as either Terrestrial, Gas Giant, or Ice Giant.
- The number of moons listed is based on current knowledge and may change as new moons are discovered.
- The names of some significant moons for each planet are listed. Each planet may have additional smaller moons not listed here.
