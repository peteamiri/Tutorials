Notes:
- Distances are in million kilometers.
- Orbital periods are in Earth days.
- Sizes are in kilometers.
- Average temperatures are approximate and may vary depending on location and other factors.
- Light travel time is the time it takes for light from the Sun to reach the planet at its average distance, calculated based on the speed of light in a vacuum (299,792 kilometers per second).
- The type of planet is categorized as Terrestrial (rocky) or Gas/Ice Giant.
- The number of moons listed is based on current knowledge and may change as new moons are discovered.
- The names of some significant moons for each planet are listed. Each planet may have additional smaller moons not listed here.

## Nearby Solar systems

Creating a table with detailed information about other solar systems beyond our own (exoplanetary systems) is challenging due to the vast number of known exoplanets and the limitations in observational data. However, I can provide a simplified table listing some notable exoplanetary systems in order of their distance from our solar system, along with basic information such as the size of the host star and the number of known planets:

| Solar System              | Distance from Our Solar System (light-years) | Size of Host Star | Number of Planets | Type of Planets                 |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------------------------|
| Proxima Centauri          | 4.24                                         | Small (Red Dwarf) | 1                 | Rocky, potentially habitable   |
| TRAPPIST-1                | 39                                           | Small (M-type)    | 7                 | Rocky, potentially habitable   |
| Kepler-11                 | ~2,000                                       | Medium (G-type)   | 6                 | Mostly gas/ice giants          |
| Kepler-90                 | ~2,500                                       | Medium (G-type)   | 8                 | Rocky, gas/ice giants          |
| HD 10180                  | ~127                                          | Medium (G-type)   | 7                 | Mix of gas giants and terrestrials |
| WASP-47                   | ~460                                          | Large (F-type)    | 4                 | Mix of gas giants and terrestrials |

Please note:
- Distances are approximate and can vary depending on the method used for measurement.
- The size of the host star is categorized as small (such as a red dwarf), medium (such as a G-type like our Sun), or large (such as an F-type).
- The number of planets listed is based on current knowledge and may change as new exoplanets are discovered.
- The type of planets is categorized broadly as rocky (terrestrial), gas giants, or ice giants, based on their composition and characteristics. Some systems may have a mix of different types of planets.

# Galaxies Near US

Creating a table with detailed information such as size in light-years for galaxies beyond our own is challenging due to the vast distances involved and limitations in observational data. However, I can provide a simplified table listing some nearby galaxies in order of their distance from the Milky Way, along with their type of galaxy:

| Galaxy                    | Type of Galaxy   | Distance from Milky Way (million light-years) | Size (approximate)     |
|---------------------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Andromeda Galaxy (M31)   | Spiral           | 2.537                                         | ~220,000 light-years    |
| Triangulum Galaxy (M33)  | Spiral           | 2.73                                          | ~60,000 light-years     |
| Large Magellanic Cloud   | Irregular        | ~160,000                                      | ~14,000 light-years     |
| Small Magellanic Cloud   | Irregular        | ~200,000                                      | ~7,000 light-years      |
| Messier 81 (Bode's Galaxy) | Spiral         | ~12 million                                   | ~95,000 light-years     |
| Messier 82 (Cigar Galaxy)  | Starburst       | ~12 million                                   | ~37,000 light-years     |

Please note:
- Distances are approximate and can vary depending on the method used for measurement.
- The types of galaxies are based on their visual appearance and structural characteristics, which are broadly classified into categories such as spiral, elliptical, irregular, and peculiar galaxies.
- The sizes of galaxies are estimated based on their observed extent, which can vary depending on the method used for measurement and the definition of the galaxy's boundaries. The sizes provided here are approximate and may not represent the full extent of each galaxy.
